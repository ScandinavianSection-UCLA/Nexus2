The story of giving or returning a glove to a merman and in return being warned of a storm is widely attested (DS II D 8). Christiansen (1958) indexes these stories as ML4055, and emphasizes the \"tit for tat\" nature of the exchange. In other stories, it is a stocking that is given to the merfolk (DS II D 4). Many of the stories include a rhyme that the merman or mermaid quotes warning the fisherman of impending disaster. Lindow mentions an early attestation of the story in the 16th century, Historia de gentibus septentrionalis II, 23, by Olaus Magnus (Lindow 1978, 127).\n\n     Merfolk and mound dwellers appear analogous in many stories, with each one residing in groups organized in ways reminiscent of Danish social organization. The mound dwellers appear in the context of human agricultural endeavor (plowing and animal herding for example) while merfolk appear in the context of fishing. \n\n     This story was collected by Karl Hjort, a teacher in \u00c5restrup, and not by Tang Kristensen. It appears in the Dansk Folkemindesamling collection 1929/001, \"Originalopskrifter af Folkeminder indsendte til E.T.K. Heri Bidrag indsendt til Folkemindesamfundet samt senere Bidrag. Ordnede alfabetisk efter Indsendernes Navne.\" [Original recordings of folklore sent to E. T. K. Including material sent to the Folklore Society as well as later materials. Arranged alphabetically according to the sender's name]. An annotation for Karl Hjort made in March 1992 lists 52 sheets in that collection attributed to him. Among Hjort's collections are eleven melodies to Jens's ballads. Tang Kristensen did not collect any of Jens's melodies himself. It is likely that Hjort was a contributor to the journal Skattegraveren as well.\n\n     Tang Kristensen mentions Karl Hjort (1848-1890) several times in his memoirs (MO II, 366; III, 29, 78, 82, 183, 260, 349). Hjort was a widower and, according to Tang Kristensen, doted on his only son. He was greatly interested in folklore and was quite musical; this likely accounts for the various ballads that he recorded and that are included in Tang Kristensen's Jyske folkeminder vol. 11 (JFm XI). Tang Kristensen considered him \"en god st\u00f8tte\" [a good support]. He often followed Tang Kristensen out to \"Bitte Jens\" (MO III, 82). Tang Kristensen usually stayed with Hjort when he visited \u00c5restrup and Jens (MO III, 82 and 183). Hjort died of tuberculosis in 1890 (MO III, 349). Tang Kristensen makes no mention of receiving any manuscripts from Hjort, although he does mention that they corresponded (MO III, 349), and it is likely in this correspondence that he included the two records attributed to him. Hjort is also mentioned in DgF (XII 237) as a collector (and not as an informant). He is also mentioned in L\u00e6rerne og samfundet (Poulsen and Benthin 1913, vol. 1, 145f).", "danish_manuscript": "No field diary recording", "english_manuscript": "There was once a fisherman on the West Sea who found a glove on the beach.

The Christmas celebrations and similar lejestuer [festive celebrations] held at various farms were one of the few chances for unmarried men and women of the parish to gather in an informal and non-work setting.\n\nTang Kristensen has written a long introduction to this record:\n\nFollowing here are certain formula that have been used at Christmas gatherings, and are deliberate twisting of expressions. While they appear to make fun of the holy word, they should rather be considered examples of youthful self confidence and enthusiasm. Several of these formula also have obscene or vulgar sections. In earlier times people didn't take this as seriously, and it often happened that, if such sentences were presented in a jocular manner, they could lead to great amusement. In particular, they would perform marriages and baptisms, imitating, using other words, church functions, into which they would infuse amusement. Twisted invitations to births or weddings were also common at these occasions and, since I have a large number of them at hand, and since there is now occasion to give some examples, they follow here as well. One should note that many of them, perhaps because of later misunderstandings, have been woven into other nonsense rhymes, so all of it has in fact become nonsense now.

In variant A, to which Jens's verse alludes, a young man is initiated into sex by an old hag. When he tries to rid himself of her by approaching the bishop, she reveals herself to be a shape shifter, ultimately turning into a werewolf whose private parts are torn out by a fence pole. In variant B, a young man marries a hag who turns out to be a witch, a surmise made explicit in a verse sung by a child at Lime school (DSkv 4). Ultimately, the young man runs an old rusty knife up into her behind, loosing a torrent of devils. In variant C, a farmhand has an affair with what he thinks is a young girl, but she turns out to be a hag--in this case, a mound woman, recognizable by her oven rake and peel-board. \n\n      It is not hard to imagine that Jens is playing somewhat with the earnest folklore collector.

In Jens's story, the mound dweller's wife is a human, explaining why she needs a human midwife. In many variants where the woman giving birth is human, she turns out to have been kidnapped into the mound, usually as a young child (DS I 860; DS I 869). Here, the kidnapping has taken place in infancy, and she is identified as a changeling. The need for a human (read Christian) midwife is somewhat harder to explain, since the changeling was presumably never baptized, and therefore much more easily assimilated into the world of mound dwellers.\n\n     The mound dweller's wife provides assistance to the midwife, providing her with a series of instructions to successfully escape the underground world. Unlike the fairytale, where such instructions (and prohibitions) would go unheeded, the midwife follows the instructions to the letter, and is richly rewarded.\n\n     As in many of these stories, the gift of the mound dweller seems at first glance to be worthless. The differing value systems of the out group are made explicit in the type of payment; once the seemingly modest, or even useless, payment is accepted (and not discarded), it turns out to be quite substantial.\n\n     The instruction to hold onto the door knocker is not widely attested, although it does occur in other variants (DS I 1122). The door, or the door knocker, must be linked to the liminality of the physical threshold/door that literally separates the inside from the outside. Tang Kristensen initially writes \"Tronbusk\" for the hawthorn bush the woman is to hold onto, transposing the \"r\" and the \"o\" and forgetting to include an \"e\"; he corrects this at the next mention of the bush. Although hawthorn is used in various folk remedies, here the requirement that she hold the hawthorn bush is more related to unlikely actions, because hawthorn bushes are covered by spines; deliberately holding onto a hawthorn is not normal, thus picking up on the liminal--and dangerous--nature of this interaction.", "danish_manuscript": "Else Hohus i R\u00e6vild var ned at forl\u00f8se en\nBj\u00e6rgmands Kone.

He'll accompany you home, but you should turn one of your mittens around, I can't remember if it was the right or the left, but either one was equally strong, and then he'll pay you, you should pick up your apron and hold what he'll give you in that, and then he'll dance with you three times around a hawthorn bush, she said, and you can grab onto it with your hand when you're done dancing; then you'll be holding onto your door knocker, she said. When he says goodbye, turn the glove around, otherwise he'll take you back down. Well, then he went off with her when they were done and then he danced with her around the thorn bush and gave her lots of big flint stones in her apron, and she held it up and and then she took hold of the knocker of her door. When he'd said good night to her he couldn't take her back with him. Then she went inside and tossed the flint stones down in front of the wood stove and then she went to bed.

Here, the manor lord recognizes the sign of impending peril--the blood red socks--and tries to develop a strategy to avoid the Devil. Unable to do so, he decides to take his money with him, by ingesting it. In other stories, \"taking it with you\" inevitably leads to haunting (JPP 1.08). Although the manor lord is unsuccessful in his rather pitiful attempt to eat the silver and generously gives the fortune to the hired girl, he apparently haunts the farm later (his haunting only appears in Tang Kristensen's emended published version).\n\n     The Devil in this story appears as the well-dressed gentleman, a widely attested form throughout northern Europe (V\u00e4lk 2001). His arrival in a fine carriage is also widely attested, mimicking the carriages of manor lords (PJ 2.01; 3.08).\n\n     While cutting live wood in forests was forbidden without specific permission from the forest owner (usually a manor lord or the Crown), collecting fallen wood was generally permitted. That people would not touch a fallen oak is significant in this context, and speaks to the fear that was attached through narrative to touching that particular tree.\n\n     Tang Kristensen makes some significant changes to the published story, adding detail that is not included in the manuscript. Most notable among these additions is the inclusion of a farmhand who confirms the haunting at the farm.

Several of the episodes--such as the girl's discovery of the manor lord's brain hanging on the walls of the room--are moved to later in the narrative.\n\n     The story has an elaborate coda that could stand as an independent story.

The reference to the rune stone found in the newly apportioned field at once emphasizes the responsibility of the individual, rather than the collective (jordf\u00e6llesskab), to care for the fields. At the same time, the discovery of the rune stone alludes to the long history of the earlier organization of the fields. The rune stone is plowed back into the field, and the historical connection between the past and the future is lost--one can no longer find the connection to the past in the current organization of the fields.\n\n     The stone described here must be absolutely massive, since four horses cannot pull it. Such a massive size is out of line with most rune stones that were of more modest proportions. The description of the runes is odd, since runes were carved into the stone, and would appear as depressions. Runes would not look as if they had been glued on to the stone. \n\n     Rune stones were less of a common find in Danish fields than they were in Swedish fields (Moltke 1976 and 1985). In Sweden, many stones were blown up by farmers intent on clearing their fields of what they considered to be nuisances. Nevertheless, there are numerous documented instances of farmers discovering rune stones and other earlier archaeological treasures while plowing. Perhaps the best known rune stones in Denmark are the two stones in the churchyard at Jelling, known as the elder and younger Jelling stones, the smaller of which was used as a bench outside of the church until 1627.     \n\n     Runes and the inscription of runes have often been attributed magical power. Rune stones themselves often refer to these powers. This story, however, makes no mention of any such magical connection. The surmise that the rune stone had stood on top of the mound is possible, although not likely, as most rune stones were placed near roads. \n\n     There are significant differences between the published version and the manuscript version. Tang Kristensen changed the source of the story from Jens's maternal aunt to his mother, and moved several other references to the timing of the story to the front of the narrative. Jens mentioned the events in a later session with Tang Kristensen in a far less detailed story (BJK 4.24). In that short narrative, Jens mentioned that the motivation for digging up the stone was to use the large rock as building material, a surprisingly common fate for many such stones.", "danish_manuscript": "Der ligger en Runesten paa den tredje Ager s\u00f8n-\nden for Bavneh\u00f8j [s\u00f8nden for Bavneh\u00f8j] saa-\ndan sagde min Moster, hendes Fader pl\u00f8jede\nimod den og s. viste h. hans Karl ud at kaste\n\n3242B\nden ned, for den var s. forf\u00e6rdelig stor at 4\nHeste kunde ikke tr\u00e6kke den derfra.

These stories are considered to be \"etiological\" as they explain the existence of an unusually large stone in the landscape, often marked by the giant's hand. \n\n     Denmark is a deeply glaciated landscape.

The first part is similar to stories classified as ATU 1359, Husband Outwits Adulteress and Lover, although in the manuscript version, the wife colludes with the husband. The Jewish peddler is simply led to believe that he is going to sleep with the farmer's wife. \n\n     The wandering merchant or peddler is well known in Danish tradition, and appears in both legend and folktales. Many of these peddlers are identified as Jewish peddlers (J\u00f8de kr\u00e6mmer). While the population of Jews in Denmark was never very large, many Jews in Denmark made their living in trade, both large and small scale. The history of Jews in Denmark is fairly complex, and laws pertaining to Jews often distinguished between Sephardic Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former receiving better treatment under the law. The first ordinance governing Jews in Denmark was promulgated February 2, 1651, by King Frederik III, in part deporting all Jews who had immigrated illegally. \n\n     Jens's story is similar to Peder Johansen's story of the farms at Heaven and Hell (PJ 1.02), particularly in the later episode where the jealous, wealthy neighbor believes their poor neighbor has been measuring money with a grain scoop. The fatal advice that the poor farmers give their neighbor is perhaps even more sadistic--and certainly more obscene--than the corresponding episode in Peder Johansen's story.\n\n     Jens reveals a great mastery of storytelling in this account, blending aspects of the humorous jocular tale, with the more believable legend and the utterly fictional folktale. References to place names, named individuals, and technology--such as the type of plow the poor sister used--play on the concept of believability, while the episode of self-mutilation and the minister relies on an absurd suspension of disbelief. The hat made from the woman's genitalia, and the man's subsequent strangulation, move the story firmly into the realm of the burlesque. The absurd final reference at the end to a series of subsequent owners of the ropes made from the hat can only be seen as Jens's own amusing meta-narrative commentary on performance.\n\n      Tang Kristensen plays rather fast and loose with the manuscript version of this story, separating it into two different accounts, the first part published as JAH V 505, and the second part remaining unpublished. JAH V 505 follows the fair copy of the story, indexed as \u00c6v. 1247, J\u00f8dekr\u00e6mmeren, until the wandering merchant is chased down to Gravlev. Tang Kristensen publishes a modified version of the second part of the story as JAH I 212 (BJK 1.20), adding the opening line \"as a satire about the previously used tool.\" Interestingly, that line refers to a story told by Kristen Kristensen Smed (JA H I 211), and not a story told by Jens. Indeed, Jens makes no other mention of leather straps or ropes in his storytelling.\n\n     In the published version of the first part of this story, Tang Kristensen adds the short sentence about the merchant losing all his possessions. To make matters more absurd, he also adds a long note after the published version of this story concerning both the injustices directed at wandering merchants and the dubious nature of many of these same merchants. Although the note encapsulates much of the debate over rural poverty and the status of wandering mendicants, particularly the kr\u00e6mmere but, by extension, the rakkere and natmandsfolk, it is utterly misplaced: \"When we hear about all the injustice and violence that have been directed at these wandering merchants, we cannot be entirely silent concerning these people's crass behavior. A large number of other fairytales and jocular legends indicate that it was not rare nor even uncommon for things to go as described above, and these descriptions seem to be in many ways taken directly from lived experiences. The merchants should not be considered as totally innocent victims, and many of them have at the very least lived a loose life. When I was a young man, a merchant managed in a quite tricky manner to get me to hide some wares for him. I had no idea there was something suspicious about this and didn't suffer any consequences, but he naturally enjoyed taking advantage of my trust and my sympathy for his difficult lot.\" The note, however profoundly felt, is disingenuous, given Tang Kristensen's overt manipulation of his source. It is possible that he wanted to cover his tracks, and added this unusual editorial, to further deflect attention from his manipulation. The story Jens tells is not about the poor lot of the wandering merchants, but rather a humorous and obscene tale about sibling rivalry gone amok.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var to S\u00f8stre der boede i Oplev, den 1 var ri\nog den 2 fattig.

They lived in Jens Markussen\u2019s and Anders Jensen\u2019s farm, the two southern farms. The poor one was a such a pretty young woman, and the other one was a little bit older. They had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, when they plowed, at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they weren\u2019t plowing, they didn\u2019t have anyone there. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to harrow with the nags herself and when they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the livestock. So one day this Jewish wandering merchant comes to the poor sister when she\u2019d just come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn\u2019t going to buy anything since she didn\u2019t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she\u2019d probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn\u2019t any, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really was interested in them, but that didn\u2019t really help matters, since she didn\u2019t have anything to pay for them with. Wouldn\u2019t get any. Then he gets her to try something on: here\u2019s a piece of clothing that he\u2019d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jews often wanted to do that. She didn\u2019t dare do that, she said, because when her husband saw it, he\u2019d want to know where she\u2019d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn\u2019t have any money. Then he takes his wallet up with all these silver coins in it and tosses a shilling to her, she could have it and her husband wouldn\u2019t need to know. When the woman saw that he had all these silver coins she looked at the sun and said, \u201cNo, it's noon now and my husband will come home. But I have another idea. Tonight he\u2019s going to the mill to get grain for the nags. You should come then and ask for lodgings for the night, then we\u2019ll work it out.\u201d He thought this was a great idea. She talks to her husband about this and said that he had all this money, and that it would be good to get a hold of the money since it was tight for them. She\u2019d convinced him. Now you should stand out in the entry and greet him, and she\u2019d listen to their conversation. Well, then the wandering merchant came and wanted lodgings for the night there, it looked like they could. No, their apartment wasn\u2019t large enough to offer people lodgings. Sure, they had enough room, he knew the place well. But they didn\u2019t have anything to put on the bed, no he\u2019d better go to the inn \u2013 there was an inn in Gravlev at that time. No, he had to head west the next morning. Well, then the husband finally let the wife take care of it. She was also hard to convince, but he was finally given permission. Then the husband puts on his long jacket, puts a sack under his arm and grabs a staff and asks his wife to feed the nags one more time, and then she was going to make an evening snack for the wandering merchant. After she\u2019d fed the merchant, they were going to go to bed. That was the most important thing. The her husband comes running in through the kitchen door with a club. The wife had been careful to tell the merchant he could put his goods in that old chest and she gave him the key, and then they went to bed. Now the husband starts beating the poor merchant. The wife she wailed that he shouldn\u2019t beat him like that. He was going to kill them both. She manages to start fighting with him and the merchant grabs his clothes and runs out the door, which her husband had opened. Her husband runs after him and chases him down to the little woods in Gravlev. So the next morning, they were going to open the chest and look through the merchant\u2019s wares, and they find a purse filled with silver coins. We can\u2019t count them, said the wife, but I\u2019ll go over to my sister and borrow her quarter measure, I think there\u2019s a whole quarter measure, we can measure the money there. What do you want it for? You don\u2019t have anything to measure. I want to measure my money. Have you gotten a hold of so many of them. So she gets it and goes home. Something glistens. It is a tiny little shilling from L\u00fcbek, and was so careless that some of them got stuck between the tangs. The sister is curious and finds the money. I have them, there is money. Where did you get them from? I\u2019ll tell you how it is. I had my husband cut my thingy out and had the girl bring it up to the minister and I got a whole quarter measure of money for it. That was quite a good price, do you think he\u2019d buy more? Yes, she figured he would. Well, she didn\u2019t really need any money, but she wanted more, and so hers too. Got her husband to take his straight-razor and sent the hired girl off with it on a white plate with a little napkin over it and up to the minister. Does he buy pussies? What did you say? Says it again. Let me see. The Devil take me, people are becoming completely stupid, they take my cows and leave me the mule. The hired girl gets so scared hearing the minister swear like that that she runs home and by that time the woman was dead. Then her husband felt that you couldn\u2019t just throw something like that away, and he figured he could make a nice cap out of it. They used to wear fox caps at the time. So he wore it to church one day and on the way home there was quite a rain storm, and it got so big that it plopped down around his neck. The hired girl had really heated up the house and so he sat down to warm himself up and as it dried out it shrunk around his neck and strangled him.  Then they had to cut it off of his neck and then they tossed it out onto the dung heap. Another man came to the farm, and it was their habit that they\u2019d drive dung out in the spring and he finds this thing in the dung heap. He figures he could make a set of reigns out of it \u2013 that\u2019s what they said back then, they used leather ropes, they were made just like hemp ropes are nowadays, and they used those as far back as I can remember, and when they\u2019d driven them to pieces and they could use them as plow guides, they had yokes or harnesses and pillows on the horses. And so he has four of these ropes made, and drives off to Nibe to get a load of herring, as was the custom in those days when he\u2019d planted. And so it gets on toward night and he\u2019s had several big drinks down there and it was night before he came back from the town. So when he was driving and got to Uslev, there\u2019s a big hill south of the town that he had to go up, he got down off the wagon and walked alongside it. It started to rain really hard. After he\u2019d gotten a ways, he decided to get back up and drive again, but the wagon was gone and he couldn\u2019t see anything on the horses except these pillows and the empty harness and it was raining and it was really dark. He had no idea what to do, so he got up on the left side horse and rode home. When he gets home, he takes the pillows and harnesses off the horses, and hung them on these large wooden hooks on the north side of the barn, that\u2019s where they hung their equipment (tack) when they came home from the fields in the spring, and he goes in and tells his wife what had happened, and that he\u2019d have to go and get the wagon, but it would have to wait until morning, since the weather was so bad. Then around dawn, it became really windy and dry, and as the ropes dried the wagon came rolling in. By the time it was 10 in the morning, his wagon and herring were home, they came right into the farmyard to him. He used those ropes as long as he was the master of the farm and his son Jens N\u00f8rgaard after him. His name was Ellavst, the man who\u2019d had the ropes made. They say after his mother. He had a son El Jens. When Peder Tygesen became the master there he had enough to use for tying his thresher.", "danish_publication": "Der boede to s\u00f8stre her i Oplev, den ene var rig, og den anden fattig.

Nej, der var ingen, det vidste hun nok. N\u00e5, han viste hende jo \u00e9t p\u00e6nt kl\u00e6de efter et andet, som kr\u00e6mmerne plejer.

They lived in Jens Markussen\u2019s and Anders Jensen\u2019s farms, the two southern farms. The rich one was the oldest and the poor one was a such a pretty young woman. When the poor sister plowed, they had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, since at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to go herself with the nags, since they didn\u2019t have a girl there except when they plowed. When they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the cattle. This Jewish wandering merchant came one day to the poor sister when she\u2019d come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn\u2019t going to buy anything since she didn\u2019t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she would probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn\u2019t any. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really wanted them, but that didn\u2019t really help matters. Then he gets her to try something on: here\u2019s a piece of clothing that he\u2019d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jewish wandering merchants liked to do that too. She didn\u2019t dare do that, because when her husband saw that she had the clothing, then he\u2019d want to know where she\u2019d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn\u2019t have any money.

Tang Kristensen was loathe to publish stories that were obscene, and there was clearly no way that he would publish this story. The self-inflicted mutilation of the greedy neighbor is an integral component of Jens's story, and the account would make little sense if he simply jumped over it. Instead, Tang Kristensen decided to eliminate it, and split the story into two parts.\n\n     Tang Kristensen had several other motivations for splitting these two parts of the story beyond the need to excise the obscene parts. By keeping the two stories together, he would have been forced to recognize the story as a fictional, humorous tale--it would neither fit into his conception of the legend, his conception of stories of daily life, nor his conception of the folktale. By breaking the stories apart, he found a reasonable solution that he felt no one would likely uncover. He could implicitly propose that the first part was a sad yet true commentary on the treatment and prejudice directed against wandering merchants--and as such an exploration of the tensions concerning the care for the poor that were an important issue in the politics of the time. The story would be classifiable as a legend, and quite at home in a section of Jyske Almueliv that was predominantly legends. \n\nThe second part of the story, without the obscene episodes, would then stand as an amusing jocular tale about farm implements. It would allow Tang Kristensen to foreground the discussion of farming implements that used to be common on Danish farms (echoing the reference to the old plow that the woman was forced to use in the previous story).

The wagon had, in fact, remained on the road, and the ropes had simply stretched a great deal in the rain. When it was ten o\u2019clock, his wagon and herring were back at the farm, it came into the farmyard to him.

Then he went off with them and they were so strong they could knock everything down. He wanted to go out and look about in the world. He went to the capital and there the royal castle was covered in black. He gets lodgings with a woman in the town. What does it mean... Yes, the king had been in trouble at sea three times, and he had promised his three daughters to three mermen in return for getting ashore. He has to give the first one tomorrow. Isn't there anyone who can save her? ... Ridder R\u00f8d (The Red Knight), but she didn't know if he could. If he stayed until dinner then he'd get to see it... Then it came. The Red Knight came too with two loaded pistols up in a big tree. The boy goes out to her. She cries and tells him. Can no one save you ... The Red Knight is afraid and up in a tree. Hurry up ... couldn't he stay. Sure ... was going to die at some point anyway. Wanted to try. Smiled a little bit to him. Tied her ring in the long hair. Are you sitting here with mine? It was mine before it was yours, and it could be mine again too. They argued over it. To Burenbrak, take care of him. Knocked him out cold, grabbed onto his neck and bit his head off. Saved. He opened the mouth and took the tongue out. Go ... in no way. Yes, leaves. The Red Knight comes down, shoots her. Takes the head. The boy goes home to the old woman. The princess had sneaked off and told her sister that a boy with three dogs had saved her. The next merman. Second princess (?). The boy again ... Had a lot to cry about ... Will also take you ... He hasn't gotten you yet said the boy. Put her ring next to her sisters. The merman was whistling and roaring out in the ocean and had so much water around him that he almost took the princess and the boy with him. Sit there ... St\u00e6rken Dreng. Couldn't do it alone. To Sn\u00e6rvind, if both dogs and they tear him apart. She hung onto him, he was to stay... The boy goes away. The Red Knight cries tears. Closed wagon down to get them...three heads. The other two hadn't combed it anyway and saw her sisters' rings in his hair, and tied hers with them, and asked if he'd be friends. Then the merman came. The Red Knight almost fell into the water the merman brought with him... Got all three dogs. Fought a long time with him. Two heads off immediately, but the third was difficult...promise to marry him. The boy left, came again after a while. There were beautiful flags and things and finery everywhere. Then the boy says to Burenbrak, go get the bottle of wine that's in front of the bride and groom. The bride got so white under her eyes that she nearly fainted. The second to get bread from the table. The boy went off to see how they celebrated the wedding. Took the dogs with him. The two princesses went up and down the floor and whispered, and the Red Knight asked if they couldn't chase the dogs out. The king gets up. The boy asked if they had to leave, he thought they were welcome. He asks the Red Knight if he had gotten his wife honestly... Who has more right ... The Red Knight sentenced to death. The boy got the youngest. [The first night he slept.] When he traveled around he came into a big forest and was let into a lonely place and comes there, it was actually a robbers fort and there was no one home except for an old woman. He asked if he could have lodgings for the night, didn't want to have the dogs inside with him. There was a room, they could stay there until the next morning early, then he could take them. She brings some porridge and milk to him. Please eat it, a good portion because it would be the last thing he got. Yes, then he got that. Finished eating. Can't I take this whistle and amuse myself a little while. The old woman had given it to him, he could whistle them to him wherever he was. Yes, you can whistle as much as you want, but you'll never get your dogs again. Heated a pot of water, and threw it down on them, so she thought that they were dead, but when he blew into the whistle, all the dogs came and stood by him and then he asked them to take a hold of her. They tore her apart and took all the gold and silver they had taken from other people, and went off to his poor parents with it; and that's when he traveled back to the capital.", "danish_publication": "Der var en Dreng der havde Lyst til at komme ud og se sig omkring i Verden. Saa tr\u00e6ffer han paa en gammel Heks, der giver ham tre Hunde: Burenbrak, St\u00e6rkendreng og Sn\u00e6rvind, og saa giver hun ham ogsaa en Fl\u00f8jte; med den kunde han fl\u00f8jte Hundene til sig, ihvor han saa var. Da han nu rejste omkring, kommer han ind i en stor Skov, og der kommer han til et eneligt Sted; det var nu ellers et R\u00f8verslot. Her var ikke andre hjemme end en gammel Kone, og hende sp\u00f8rger han, om han kunde ikke faa Kvarter om Natten. Jo, det kunde han nok, men hun vilde ikke have de Hunde inde ved ham. Her var et Kammer, de kunde staa i til i Morgen tidlig, saa kunde han der tage dem. Saa kommer hun med noget Gr\u00f8d og M\u00e6lk til ham og sagde, han skulde v\u00e6re saa god at \u00e6de et godt Livfuld af det, for det blev det sidste, han fik. Jo, saa fik han det, og da han havde afspist, saa siger han: \u201dMaa a ikke tage denher Fl\u00f8jte og more mig et bitte Korn?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, du kan fl\u00f8jte saa meget du vil,\u201d siger hun, \u201dmen dine Hunde faar du aldrig igjen!\u201d For ilav han sad og spiste, da havde hun varmet en Kjedelfuld Vand og h\u00e6ldt ind paa dem, saa hun mendte, de var d\u00f8de. Man da han bl\u00e6ste i hans Fl\u00f8jte, kom alle Hundene og stod ved ham. Saa bad han dem tage fat paa hende, og nu splittede de hende ad. Han tog saa alt det Guld og S\u00f8lv, der var i R\u00f8verkulen; det havde de jo taget fra andre Folk, og rejste hjem til hans fattige For\u00e6ldre med det. Nu kom han i Tanker om, han vilde gj\u00f8re en Tur til Hovedstaden med hans Hunde, for de var jo saa st\u00e6rke, te de kunde slaa al Ting ned. Da han kom der, var det kongelige Slot overtr\u00e6kket med sort. Saa faar han Kvarter ved en Kone i Byen, og han sp\u00f8rger hende jo om, hvad det havde at betyde. \u201dJo,\u201d siger hun, \u201dKongen har tre Gange v\u00e6ret i Havsn\u00f8d, og han har ogsaa tre D\u00f8tre; hem har han lovet hen til tre Havm\u00e6nd, for at de skulde hj\u00e6lpe ham i Land.\u201d Nu skulde den ene Datter gives hen i Morgen. \u201dEr der ingen, der kan redde hende?\u201d siger Drengen. Jo, der var rigtig nok en, der hed Ridder R\u00f8d, han havde b\u00f8dere sig til, men hun kunde ikke vide, om han kunde! \u201dJa, saa vil a da blive hertil Middagstid,\u201d siger Drengen, \u201dfor at a kan faa det at se.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, du kan nok faa det at se,\u201d siger hun, \u201dmen det er vist ikke raadeligt for dig at komme alt for meget i N\u00e6rheden!\u201d Saa kom Prinsessen ogsaa kj\u00f8rende forbi og sat ned paa Stranden, og Ridder R\u00f8d var med. Han havde to ladte Pistoler med sig, men han kr\u00f8b op i et stort Tr\u00e6. Saa kommer Drengen derud, og da sad Prinsessen og gr\u00e6d. Han vil saa have hende til at fort\u00e6lle, hvad hun gr\u00e6d for, og det fortalte hun ogsaa. \u201dEr der da ingen, der kan frelse dig?\u201d siger han. \u201dNej, der var ikke,\u201d siger hun, \u201dfor Ridder R\u00f8d har nok lovet det, men han er bange og sidder oppe i det store Tr\u00e6. Skynd dig nu at komme afsted herfra, for nu kommer Dragen snart!\u201d siger hun. Ja, om han da ikke maatte blive. \u201dJo, det maa du jo godt, men saa skal du d\u00f8 ogsaa, det bliver ikke til andet!\u201d Ja, han skulde d\u00f8 en Gang alligevel, han vilde da pr\u00f8ve, hvor galt det kunde gaa! Ved de Ord smilte hun et bitte Korn til ham. Saa sad hun og bandt hendes Ring i hans lange Haar. Men saa med \u00e9t kom Havmanden susende og b\u00f8dlende ude i Havet, og han havde saa meget Vand om sig, te det havde n\u00e6r taget baade Drengen og Prinsessen med sig. Han br\u00f8lte saa til ham: \u201dSidder du her ved min!\u201d Dertil svarte Drengen: \u201dJa, det var min, f\u00f8r det blev din, og kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det vil vi snubbes om!\u201d Saa siger Drengen til Burenbrak, te han skal tage ved ham. Den afsted derhen og rendte ham omkuld og toge saa i Kardusere af ham og bed hans Hoveder af lige paa \u00e9n Gang. Nu var Prinsessen altsaa frelst. Han lujt saa Munden op og tog Tungen ud, og den gjemte han i hans Lommekl\u00e6de. Nu vilde han til at gaa, men saa sagde hun til ham, at det maatte han da paa ingen Maade! Jo, han vilde afsted, og han rejste ogsaa af. Nu kom Ridder R\u00f8d ned af Tr\u00e6et, og han truede hende med, at han vilde skyde hende, hvis hun ikke gik ind paa at tilstaa for hendes Fader, at han havde frelst hende. Han tog saa Hovedet af Dragen med sig i Vognen, og saa f\u00f8rte han Prinsessen hjem til hendes Fader. Men Drengen var jo tagen tilbage til den gamle Kone. Hun siger: \u201dSaa kunde Ridder R\u00f8d endda faa Magt med Dragen, for nu er Prinsessen kommen tilbage.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, han kunde jo saa,\u201d sagde Drengen. Dagen efter skulde saa den anden Prinsesse afsted. Den \u00e6ldste S\u00f8ster havde listet sig til at hviske til hende, te en Dreng med tre Hunde havde frelst hende. Ridder R\u00f8d kj\u00f8rte hende saa ned og kr\u00f8b som s\u00e6dvanlig op i Tr\u00e6et. Saa kom Drengen og spurgte, hvad hun sad og gr\u00e6d for. \u201dJa, a kan nok have noget at gr\u00e6de for,\u201d siger hun, \u201dfor nu kommer Dragen snart, og Ridder R\u00f8d har forladt mig. Du maa helst se at komme bort nu, ellers tager han dig ogsaa!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, han har ikke faaet dig end,\u201d siger Drengen, \u201dlad os nu se, hvordan det kan gaa!\u201d Saa sad hun og bandt hendes Ring i hans Haar ved siden af S\u00f8sterens. Nu kom Havmanden susende og b\u00f8dlende, og han havde saa meget Vand om sig, te det n\u00e6r havde taget Prinsessen og Drengen med sig. Den Havmand havde to Hoveder, og han br\u00f8lte: \u201dSidder du her ved min!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det var min, f\u00f8r det blev din,\u201d sagde Drengen, \u201dog det kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det vil snubbes om.\u201d Saa raaber Drengen paa St\u00e6rkendreng, han skal gj\u00f8e det af med ham, og han flyver til, men han kan ikke gj\u00f8re det ene, og saa maa han have kaldt paa Sn\u00e6rvind. Nu var begge Hunde om ham, og saa split de ham ad. Drengen tog saa Tungerne ud og gjemte, og saa vilde han afsted. Prinsessen h\u00e6ngte i ham; han skulde have blevet og fulgt med hende hjem, men det vilde han ikke, og saa rejste han af. Saa kom Ridder R\u00f8d og truede hende til at sige, det var ham, der havde frelst hende. Der kom en lukket Vogn ned at hente dem, og han tog Dragehovederne med sig hjem. Saa kommer den tredje Dag, og da skal den tredje Prinsesse afsted. De to \u00e6ldste havde ikke tejen det til hende alligevel, men havde hvisket til hende, te en Dreng med tre Hunde havde frelst dem. Han kommer saa ned til hende, og da hun saa hendes S\u00f8stres Ringe i hans Haar, saa bandt hun ogsaa hendes ved og spurgte, om han vilde blive venner (ved hende). Saa kom Havmanden, og han havde tre Hoveder, og han f\u00f8rte saa meget Vand med sig, te det havde n\u00e6r skyllet Ridder R\u00f8d med sig ogsaa. Han br\u00f8lte jo: \u201dSidder du her ved min!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det var min, f\u00f8r det blev din, og kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det vil vi snubbes om,\u201d siger Dragen, og saa pudser Drengen Sn\u00e6rvind paa ham. Men han kunde ikke magte ham, og til sidst maatte alle tre Hunde have fat, og de sloges l\u00e6nge med ham: De to Hoveder fik de af straks, men det tredje kneb det med. Endelig fik de dog Magten og rev ogsaa det af. Nu vilde Drengen afsted, men Prinsessen bad ham om at blive og holdt paa ham, og han maatte da til sidst love, at han vilde komme igjen efter en Tidlang. Saa tog han jo tungene med sig og kom hjem til den gamle Kone. Nu kom Ridder R\u00f8d ned, og han truede hende til at love, at hun vilde have ham til hendes Mand. Saa kom de hjem, og han havde Hovederne med sig. Nu blev der jo gjrt stor Stads af ham, og Kongen gik ind paa, at han skulde have den sidste Prinsesse til \u00c6gte, og der blev saa stilt an til Bryllup. Nu var Drengen rejst bort en Tid, men saa kom han igjen, og da glimrede al Ting paa Slottet med Stads og Flag. Saa kommer han ned til den gamle Kone og siger: \u201dNaa, nu er de vel gift?\u201d Nej, de var da ikke endnu, men i Dag skulde Brylluppet staaa. Som de saa sidder ved Taffelet, siger Drengen til Burenbrak, han skal l\u00f8be op og hente den Flaske Vin, der staar for F\u00e6stemanden og Bruden. Det gj\u00f8r den ogsaa, og da Bruden faa Hunden at se, saa bliver hun saa hvid under \u00d8jnene, te hun havde n\u00e6r Daanet. Hunden kommer tilbage med Flasken, og saa sender han St\u00e6rkendreng afsted efter noget af det Br\u00f8d, der er paa Bordet, og det kneb sv\u00e6rt for den at faa det. Endelig vil Drengen selv hen og se, hvordan de holdt Bryllup, og han gaar saa op til Slottet og tager hans Hunde med sig. Da han kommer, gaar de to Prinsesser op og ned ad Gulvet og hviskede. Saa siger Ridder R\u00f8d, om de Hunde kunde ikke blive jaget ud, og Kongen han rejser sig fra Bordet. Men Drengen siger, om de ikke nok maatte gaa, han t\u00e6nkte, han var velkommen, og saa sp\u00f8rger han Ridder R\u00f8d, om han var kommen \u00e6rlig til den Kone, han der havde faaet sig. Jo, han havde vundet hende ved at frelse hende fra Dragen, og det var der Bevis for i de 3 Hoveder, der stod! Saa siger Drengen: \u201dHvem mon her har mest Ret til at tale om det, enten den, der har Hovederne, eller den, der har Tungerne?\u201d Saa kunde Kongen nok forstaa, dether var galt. Han saa Tungerne, og han satte dem i Hovederne, og saa maatte Ridder R\u00f8d gaa til Bekjendelse. Han blev saa d\u00f8mt til D\u00f8den, og Drengen kom saa paa Pladsen ved Taffelet for ham og blev gift med den yngste Prinsesse.", "english_publication": "There was a boy who wanted to get out and look around in the world. Then he meets an old witch who gives him three dogs: Burenbrak, St\u00e6rkendreng and Sn\u00e6rvind, and then she also gives him a whistle which he could use to whistle the dogs to him, regardless of where he was. Now as he traveled about, he comes into a large forest, and he comes to an isolated place there; it was in fact a robbers\u2019 fort. No one was at home except for an old woman and he asks her if he could have lodgings there for the night. Sure, he certainly could, but she did not want to have the dogs in with him. Here was a room, they could stay there until the next morning, and then he could come get them. Then she comes with some porridge and milk for him and said that he was welcome to eat a big bowl of that, because it would be the last thing he got. Well, he got that, and when he had finished eating, he says: \u201cCan I take this here whistle and amuse myself with it for a little while?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, you can whistle as much as you want,\u201d she says, \u201cbut you will never get your dogs again!\u201d Because while he had been eating she had warmed up a kettle of water and thrown it in at them, and so she figured that they were dead. But as soon as he blew on his whistle, all the dogs came and stood by him. So he took all the gold and silver there was in the robbers\u2019 den, they had taken that from other people, and traveled home to his poor parents with it. Now he decided that he wanted to take a trip to the capital with his dogs, since they were so strong they could knock everything down. When he got there, the Royal castle was covered in black. Then he gets lodgings with a woman in the town, and he asks her what that was supposed to mean. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cthe King has been in trouble three times, and he also has three daughters; he has promised them to three mermen in exchange for their help here in the country.\u201d Now the one daughter was to be handed over later that morning. \u201cIs there no one who can save her?\u201d says the boy. Well, there is in fact one, who is called the Red Knight, he had offered, but she didn\u2019t know if he really could. \u201cWell, then I\u2019ll stay here until noon,\u201d says the boy, \u201cso I can get to see that.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, you can certainly get to see it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it probably is not too good to get too close!\u201d Then the princess came driving by and was put down on the beach, and the Red Knight was with her. He had two loaded pistols with him, but he climbed up into a big tree. Then the boy goes out there, and the princess was sitting there crying. He wanted her to tell him what she was crying about, and she told him too. \u201cIs there no one who can save you?\u201d he says. \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the Red Knight promised to, but he\u2019s afraid and is sitting up in a big tree. Hurry up and get out of here, because the dragon will be coming soon!\u201d she says. Well, couldn\u2019t he stay? \u201cSure, you may, but then you\u2019ll die too, there\u2019s no way around it.\u201d Well, he was going to die at some point anyway, he wanted to see how bad things could go! With those words, she smiled a little at him. Then she sat and bound her ring in his long hair. But then all of a sudden the merman came whistling and roaring out of the sea, and he had so much water around him that it almost took the princess and boy with it. He roared at him: \u201cAre you sitting here with mine!\u201d The boy answers that: \u201cWell, it was mine before it was yours, and can certainly become that again!\u201d Then the boy says to Burenbrak, that he should attack him. It runs over there and knocked him out and grabbed his necks and bit all his heads off all at once. Now the princess had been saved. He opened the mouth and took the tongue out, and he hid it in his handkerchief. Now he wanted to leave, but then she said to him, that he absolutely could not! Well, he wanted to leave and so he did. Now the Red Knight comes down out of the tree and he threatened that he would shoot her if she didn\u2019t tell her father that he had saved her. He took the head of the dragon with him in the wagon, and then he brought the princess home to her father. But the boy had gone back to the old woman. She says: \u201cSo, the Red Knight managed to get power over the dragon after all, since now the princess has come back.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, he managed to,\u201d said the boy. The next day, the second princess was to go off. The oldest sister had managed to whisper to her that a boy with three dogs had saved her. The Red Knight drove her down there and crawled as usual up the tree. Then the boy came and asked what she was sitting there crying about. \u201cWell, I have enough to cry about,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the dragon is coming soon, and the Red Knight has abandoned me. You\u2019d better see about getting out of here now, otherwise he\u2019ll take you too!\u201d \u2013Well, he hasn\u2019t gotten you yet, says the boy, \u201clet\u2019s see how things can go!\u201d Then she sat and bound her ring in his hair beside her sister\u2019s. Now the merman came whistling and roaring, and he had so much water about him that it almost took the princess and the boy with it. That merman had two heads, and he roared: \u201cAre you sitting here with mine!\u201d --  \u201cWell, it was mine before it was yours,\u201d says the boy, \u201cand can certainly become that again!\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, we\u2019ll fight over that.\u201d Then the boy calls for St\u00e6rkendreng, he should off him, and he flies at him, but he can\u2019t do it alone, and so he has to call for Sn\u00e6rvind. Now both dogs were on him, and then they destroyed him. The boy took the tongues out and hid them, and then wanted to leave. The princess hung on to him; he should have stayed and accompanied her home, but he didn\u2019t want to do that, and then he left. Then the Red Knight came and threatened her and made her say that it was he who had saved her. A closed wagon came to get them, and he took the dragon heads along home. Then the third day comes, and the third princess is to go off. The two oldest hadn\u2019t blabbered to her after all, but they had whispered to her that a boy with three dogs had saved them. He comes down to her, and when she saw her sisters\u2019 rings in his hair, she bound her ring there too and asked if they could be friends. Then the merman came, and he had three heads and he brought so much water with him he almost managed to wash the Red Knight away as well. He roared: \u201cAre you sitting here with mine!\u201d --  \u201cWell, it was mine before it was yours, and can certainly become that again!\u201d -- \u201cWell, we\u2019ll fight over that,\u201d says the dragon and then the boy sics Sn\u00e6rvind on him. But he couldn\u2019t overpower him, and finally all three dogs had to take hold, and they fought with him for quite a while: they got two of the heads off immediately, but there was a problem with the third one. Finally they got control and ripped that one off too. Now the boy wanted to leave, but the princess asked him to stay and held on to him, and he had to finally promise that he would come again after a while. Then he took the tongues along with him and he went home to the old woman. Then the Red Knight came down and he threatened her and made her promise that she would take him as her husband. Then they got home and he had the heads with him. Now he was greatly honored and the king agreed that he should marry the last princess and they started to prepare for a wedding. Now the boy had traveled off a while but then he had come back again and everything was shining at the castle with decorations and flags. Then he goes in to the old woman and says: \u201cWell, they\u2019re probably married now.\u201d No, they weren\u2019t yet, but the wedding was today. As they are sitting down to the table, the boy says to Burenbrak, he should run up and get them the bottle of wine that was in front of the bride and groom. It does that too, and when the bride sees the dog, she gets so white under her eyes that she almost fainted. The dog comes back with the bottle and then he sends St\u00e6rkendreng up to get some of the bread that is on the table, and it had a really hard time getting it. Finally the boy wants to go up and see how they held a wedding and goes up to the castle and takes his dogs with him. When he gets there, the two princesses are walking up and down the floor, whispering. Then the Red Knight asks if the dogs couldn\u2019t be chased out, and the king gets up from the table. But the boy asks if they couldn\u2019t stay, he thought he was welcome, and then he asks the Red Knight if he had gotten that wife honestly. Yes, he had won her by saving her from the dragon, and the evidence was the three heads sitting there!\u201d Then the boy says: \u201cWho has the most right to speak of that, the one who has the heads, or the one who has the tongues?\u201d Then the king understood that this was wrong. He saw the tongues and he put them in the heads, and then the Red Knight had to admit everything. He was sentenced to death and the boy was then celebrated at the table there and he was married to the youngest princess."}, {"story_id": 25, "full_name": "150 - 1.22 - DSkv_0_78", "publication_info": "DSkv_0_78", "annotation": "Tang Kristensen labels this ballad \"Hver med sit s\u00e6rkjende\" [Each with their own distinctive feature].

Here, the elf hag, known as a seductress from other stories, approaches him, ostensibly to warm herself. The man assaults her--in this case, sexually--and she in turn calls for assistance.\n\n     The story is closely related to Jens Peter's story of the injured mermaid, who calls to the merman to protect her (JPP 2.20 and JPP 4.02). In both cases, the man guarding a solitary refinery burns the supernatural being. The being responds with an obscure exclamation, similar to the statement in the legend of Pan's death (JPP 4.12). Unlike Jens Peter's story, Bitte Jens includes the clever response of the collier that allows him enough time to escape from the trolls. The resulting destruction is similar in both stories. \n\n     Peat was commonly used as a heating fuel. Although it burned at a low temperature and created a lot of smoke, it was readily available. Charcoal, by contrast, burned cleanly at a high temperature, and for a long time. It was not commonly used to heat houses since wood was scarce; rather it was used for fires that needed to be hot such as those used for smithing. Charcoal was made in a pit, referred to as a pile, by directly burning the wood that was to become charcoal. Making charcoal in pits was difficult and the piles required a great deal of attention from the colliers. Oxygen entering the pit was regulated, so that the charcoal itself did not burn. An abandoned pile could burn out of control and quite possibly explode.", "danish_manuscript": "Saadan fortalte de ogsaa om en M. fra Rold, det var ogsaa dh. Bj\u00e6rgf.

Sk\u00f8rping marsh stretches for several kilometers to the south. The distance from Sk\u00f8rping marsh to Stubberuphus voldsted is approximately six and a half kilometers.\n\n     Egholm Castle, which lies on a small island south east of Sk\u00f8rping, has a history dating back to the time of King Valdemar Sejr (1202-1241). The main building at Egholm was in fact blown to smithereens in 1765, not by the Queen but by its owner at the time, Frederik Chr. Rosenkrands, who later became prime minister. Early maps note the ruins at Egholm Castle to the north and west of Gammel Sk\u00f8rping. In other stories, Margaret's stone is located close to the castle walls of Egholm (DS IV 151).\n\n     In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen concatenates, and rearranges several of Jens's stories, presenting a series of tangentially related stories as a coherent whole.

In the first story, Kr\u00e6n Degn does not join the joking, because he believes that Anders B\u00f8dker has cursed his fields, leading to considerable financial hardship. Given Anders's response to Poul's request, it seems that Jens is unsure whether to believe the alleged curse or not. The story, in that sense, mimics a similar negotiation that informs the townspeople's interaction with Anders as well. Although Kr\u00e6n is clearly convinced of Anders's maliciousness (and thus implicitly aligning him with witchcraft), the others seem less convinced.\n\n    The cursed cattle and fields carry over to the curse on technology in the next story. By the second half of the nineteenth century, new types of plows, particularly the swing plow, were replacing the earlier wheeled plows. These plows required fewer draught animals to pull them, yet they also required farmers' to develop new skills to use them effectively.  Pulling out of the furrows, or plowing too deep would, of course, lead to unsatisfactory results. The cunning man appears to be part technician in this story, making adjustments to the poorly functioning plow. While witches are generally blamed for cursing plows, the mare and the Wandering Jew are also known to curse them. \n\n    Neither Anders B\u00f8dker, Iver Ott nor Old Villads are mentioned in H. P. Hansen's two volume work on cunning folk (1943) or R\u00f8rbye's later overview of cunning folk in Denmark (R\u00f8rbye 1976).

The premise \"the older, the better,\" or in this case, \"the older, the more powerful\" informs this story, as does an interesting notion of contagious magic. Since this bible was ostensibly written at the time when two of the most powerful figures in Christianity were alive, the book is closer to the \"source,\" and thereby more powerful than a normal bible.

Foremost among these complaints was that employers did not allow them to attend family celebrations. The girl's suicide is an extreme example of the anguish caused by restrictive employment contracts.\n\n    Committing suicide was deeply taboo, and the bodies of suicides were not buried in the church cemetery.

That the oxen in this case bring her to the churchyard indicates her virtue, an interpretation confirmed in the story by the minister's evaluative comment.

Here, the hunter is forced to chase the elf hags much further afield than he had intended.

The farmhand appeals to a local cunning man, and the advice he receives is sound. In the resolution, the witch is revealed to be the dean's wife. \n\n     The implicit connection in this story between the dean and Satan can be interpreted in several ways. On the one hand, that the dean is married to a witch suggests a profound degree of corruption and hypocrisy in the high church officer's own home. On the other hand, the marriage to the well-concealed witch--and by extension the devil--may suggest that this Satanic threat has reached the innermost circle of the church undetected, and thus threatens the very foundations of the community.\n\n      The boy's symptoms are similar to those of people who have been ridden by the mare; the witch's ride is an analogous phenomenon (KMP 1.37; DS II F 90, 93-95). In this story, the boy, transformed into a horse, is able to turn the tables on the witch, and have her shod before revealing her identity. Revealing the identity of the witch often included public humiliation (JPP 1.05).\n\n      Troms cathedral in Norway was the Danish tradition dominant for the location of the witches' sabbath. Bloksbj\u00e6rg, a mountain in an unspecified, yet distant location, is also widely attested as the location of this gathering (DS VII 335 and 336).

The werewolf is also a threat to the physical well-being of the insiders. In some accounts, the only way a werewolf can become free of the curse is to eat the heart of an unborn child, solidifying the werewolf's role as a threat to fertility (DS II F 2).\n\n     The werewolf in the first of Jens's stories is unusual, since werewolves are predominantly men. Women were said to perform the described ritual, usually involving a horse placenta rather than a horse hide, to avoid the pains of childbirth (DS II F 1). If the child was a boy, he would become a werewolf, and if the child a girl, she would become a mare. The horse's placenta offers a direct connection (contagious magic) to the riding of the mare, while the goal of an easy of childbirth--\"as easy as a horse giving birth\" (DS II F 4)--is related to the mimicking of childbirth in the action of passing through the placenta (sympathetic magic). The ritual is also reminiscent of the failed blood-brotherhood ritual described in G\u00edsla saga, where a piece of sod is raised on poles for the intended brothers to pass underneath. \n\n      The second story, a variant of a widely attested story of recognizing the werewolf and thereby eliminating the curse, includes the more common male werewolf. Threads or pieces of cloth caught in the farmhand's teeth are the most common tokens revealing his identity as a werewolf (DS II F 18).", "danish_manuscript": "Min Fader har fortalt at der  en G. var 2 Kj\u00e6llinger\nder trak af deres Kl\u00e6der og kr\u00f8b igj. en Heste\nhud de havde h\u00e6ngt op paa en Pind og de var\nfrugtsommelige.

There was a young husband and a young wife there, and their pensioners had died, and the pensioners' house stood vacant. Then the farmhand seduced the girl and then she asked the husband if she couldn't stay in the pensioner's house and have her child and he was going to drive the cattle down to Holsten. It was in the spring time as was the custom in the old days. The girl and the farmhand got married, and then he set off on his trip. Then she gave birth to a boy, it was [probably] before he set off, because when the child was brought to the church, they had their wedding at the same time. When he now gets up to Holsten and had gotten rid of the cattle, he stayed there and he started working for a man, but he wouldn't pay him until he saw how he well he worked and whether they could get along with each other. Well, that was OK by him. One week after another went by and he didn't offer him anything and the farmhand didn't demand anything, but he got everything that he needed, and he went about as if he was one of their own, and he stayed there for eighteen years. Then he said to the man one day: Tomorrow I'm going to go home and see to my wife and son. What, are you married? Yes, he was. He had started to think about going home. And so they decided to have a happy day together that day, and so they began drinking. Then he'd put all his earnings together and it amounted to 300 daler, that was a lot of money in the old days. Now, if you'll give me 100 daler, I'll give you a piece of advice that will help you, because you've got a long journey ahead of you. He wasn't to take any shortcuts, but follow the actual road. They had a few more drams. If he'd give him another 100 daler, he'd give him another piece of advice. He shouldn't take lodgings there where the fox had built over the crow, he'd run into trouble there. They continued on like that for so long, that he gave him all his money. Don't take lodgings where there's an old man and a young woman, he'd run into trouble there too. There was another piece of advice. Don't do any deeds that he didn't know were good, unless he'd recited [read] the Our Father three times. Then the wife said: Well, now our father wasted your time today, and I'll waste your time tomorrow, I'm going to bake and you're going to get a nice cake for the trip. He got the nice cake and he wasn't to cut into it until he got home, and if his wife was dead, he was to come back and bring the cake back, and he promised that. The first day that he was out traveling, he ran into a peddler [kr\u00e6mmer] and they came to a forest, and the peddler says there that they should go this way, since it was a bit shorter than the road. He thinks about it a little bit, but then he says no, he wants to follow the road. When the peddler had gone a little way, he began to cry and scream, robbers had come after him. Then he thought to himself, the money he'd spent on the good advice wasn't wasted. Then he came to a lonely place in the forest and it was evening and he goes and asks for lodgings, and he certainly could stay. That evening they ate dinner and there was an old man by the table and he had red hair and a black beard. Then he thought, I'm going to run into trouble here. Then there was a girl who was supposed to show him to his room upstairs, and then she said that she really was sorry for him. Why, he says. Because when they get home (the robbers weren't home except for the old man with whom he'd talked and eaten), then they'd kill him. But there was a rope hanging there, let me tie it around you and then let you down out the window. She did that, and then he walked away from there and got away. Then he found lodgings in another farm the next night. There was an old man there in the farm. He asks him if he could have lodgings. Yes, he certainly could. He could go in to his wife. So he did and someone comes running at him with his pants down around his ankles, and then he saw that there was a young wife, and when he sees this he thinks, I'm going to run into trouble here. Then the old man comes in. Then she says, What kind of a person was it you sent in to me, he wanted to get up on top of me like the Devil. Yes, he couldn't have known that. Well, that's how it was. Yes, well he should be arrested, said the man, and they send for the parish bailiff. [In Torsted, they say T\u00e5ste, st\u00e5rk, but here they say T\u00f8ste, st\u00f8rk] and two men came to sit and watch over him. But during the night they fell asleep, but the prisoner didn't. Then someone came up to the window and he said to him: Tomorrow he was to be driven to the district bailiff and be tried. But they won't believe anything you say and they'll say it's a lie. The one who was on top of the wife, that was their minister. But then he was to say: He should witness, the one who is walking outside here. You can see me, but the others can't. He was to say it as it was. Then they get to the courthouse and the trial. I'm sure he was there to help the wife, the minister was, and he was also there to witness. Then the farmhand says, while pointing at the minister, that that was the person, who came at him with his pants down around his ankles, and the one who was standing outside would bear witness to that, and could he be allowed to call him. Yes, he may and the farmhand goes over to the window, and calls and calls to him and asks if he could bear witness to that which he said. He said yes. Then the minister and the wife both swore, the Devil may take them, that it was a lie and then he took the one by the arm and the other by the neck and took off with them. When he gets home, his wife didn't recognize him. He asks if he couldn't stay there. Yes, he could certainly stay, but she didn't have any place for him to lie down, since she only had one bed. Yes, he could sit on a stool at night. When it gets to being bedtime, a young person comes and lies down in the bed next to the wife. Some time out into the night, someone comes and raps on the window and says, the person who is lying there has lain with your wife every night since you left., and if I were you, I'd go over and smash his head in or slit his throat. Yes, he also went over there and was going to slit his throat. But then he remembered that he should say the Our Father. Then the person wakes up and says, Oh, mother, I dreamed that my father was here and he was here next to the bed, and wanted to slit my throat. Oh, your father, she said, it's been eighteen years since I last saw him, he's probably been dead for a long time. Then he heard that it was his son. Then he hadn't spent the money poorly for that piece of advice, otherwise he would have slit the throat of his own son. The next morning he wanted his son to go get a pitcher of ale for him. He did it too. Then he also wanted him to drink it with him. But then the mother said, no, he may not, because he was to go to work. Then he told them who he was, and then he cut into the cake and there was all the money and they're living well to this very day.

Det faar hun og Lov til, men Karlen og Pigen blev da gift, inden han rejste. Men Barnet var da f\u00f8dt forinden, og det var en Dreng, og det var ogsaa i Kirke, for de gjorde Bryllup med det samme. Altsaa rejste han af. Da han nu kommer op ad Holsten og var bleven skilt ved Studene, saa blev han der oppe med det samme og kom til at tjene en Mand der. Han vilde ikke give ham nogen L\u00f8n, inden han fik at se, hvordan han var, og hvordan de kunde komme afsted med hverandre. Ja, det var denher Studedriver ogsaa godt forn\u00f8jet med. Der gik en Uge hen efter en anden, og Manden tilb\u00f8d ham intet, og Karlen forlangte heller intet, men hvad han tr\u00e6ngte til, det fik han, og saadan blev han ved at gaa der i 18 Aar og gik der som deres egen. Saa siger han til Manden en Dag: \u201dI Morgen vil a hjem og se til min Kone og min S\u00f8n,\u201d \u2013 \u201dHvad, er du gift?\u201d siger Manden. Ja, han var, og nu var han komme i Tanker om at ville hjem, for han l\u00e6ngtes. \u201dJa, saa vil vi have os en glad Dag i Dag,\u201d siger Manden, og saa satte de dem til at svire. Han havde sanket hans L\u00f8n sammen, som han vilde give ham, og det var bleven til 300 Daler, det var store Penge i gammel Tid. De sidder saa og snakker og drikker, og saa siger Manden: \u201dDu staar en lang Rejse for, og dersom du vil give mig 100 Daler, saa vil a give dig et godt Raad, som du kan have stor Nytte af.\u201d Ja, det vilde han godt, og de gj\u00f8r den Handel. Raadet det var, at han maatte ikke gaa nogen Gjenvej, men skulde f\u00f8lge den rele Landevej. Saa fik de nogle flere Dramme, og saa siger Manden: \u201dVil du give mig 100 Daler til, saa skal a l\u00e6re dig nok et godt Raad.\u201d Ja, det gik han ind paa. \u201dDu maa ikk tage Kvarter, hvor R\u00e6ven bygger over Ravnen, for der kommer du skidt afsted.\u201d Han blev saa ved med ham saa l\u00e6nge, til han gav ham alle Penge efter, og saa skulde han have et Raad til, og det var, at han ikke maatte tage Kvarter, hvor der var en gammel Mang og en ung Kone, for det kom han ogsaa skidt fra. Og saa vilde han give ham endnu et godt Raad i Tilgift, og det var, at han ikke maatte tage sig nogen Gj\u00e6rninger for, som han ikke vidste var gode, f\u00f8rend han havde l\u00e6st hans Herrens B\u00f8n tre gange. Saa siger Konen: \u201dJa, nu har vor Faaer t\u00f8dt dig i Dag, men nu vil a t\u00f8de dig i Morgen, for a skal til at bage, og saa skal du faa en fin Kage med dig paa Rejsen.\u201d Den fine Kage fik han, og Konen sagde til ham, at han maatte ikke skj\u00e6re Hul paa den, inden han kom hjem, og hvis hans Kone var d\u00f8d, saa skulde han komme igjen og levere Kagen tilbage. Det lovede han, og saa rejste han. Den f\u00f8rste Dag han var ude at rejse, da kom han til en Kr\u00e6mmer og kom til at f\u00f8lges med ham, for de skulde \u00e9n vej. Saa kommer de til en Skov, og saa siger Kr\u00e6mmeren: \u201dHer gaar en Vej ind igjennem som er meget n\u00e6rere end Landevejen.\u201d Han bet\u00e6nker sig en bitte Krumme, men saa siger han nej, han vilde f\u00f8lge Landevejen. Men Kr\u00e6mmeren vilde den anden Vej, og saa skiltes de paa det. Da Kr\u00e6mmeren saa var kommen et bitte Stykke ind i Skoven, saa begynder han at hv\u00e6lle og skrige, for der var kommen R\u00f8vere efter ham. Saa t\u00e6nkte Karlen ved sig selv: \u201dDa stedte a ikke de Penge ilde, a gav for det f\u00f8rste gode Raad.\u201d Han kommer saa omsider til et enligt Sted inde i Skoven, og da var det blevet Aften, og han gaar saa dertil og beder om Kvarter. Det kunde han saa meget vel faa. Som de saa sidder og siser N\u00e6tter om Aftenen, saa sidder der en gammel Mand ved Bordet, og han havde r\u00f8dt Haar og sort Skj\u00e6g. Saa t\u00e6nker Karlen: \u201dDet kommer a nok skidt afsted med.\u201d Der var saa en Pige, der skulde vise ham op paa et Kammer oppe ovenpaa, og saa siger hun: \u201dA har saa ondt af det for dig.\u201d \u201dHvad for det?\u201d siger han. \u201dJo, for R\u00f8verne de er ikke hjemme, det er jo en R\u00f8verkule, du er kommen til, og det er ikke uden de gamle, du har siddet og spist med og snakket med, naar de kommer hjem, saa tager de dig af med Livet. Men her h\u00e6nger et Stykke Reb, lad mig binde det paa dig, saa kan du selv hejse dig ud af et Vindue og ned til Jorden.\u201d Han takkede hende og fik Rebet, og saa hejsede han sig ned og gik derfra og kom v\u00e6k. Han gaar nu videre den Nat og den n\u00e6ste Dag, og saa kommer hamn til at losere i en anden Gaard Natten efter. Der gik en gammel Man ude i Gaarden, og han gik jo hen til ham og spurgte, om han han kunde faa Kvarter. Jo, det kunde han gj\u00e6rne. Han kunde gaa ind til Konen, saa skulde han nok selv komme ind til ham, naar han var f\u00e6rdig med at r\u00f8gte ud. Han gik ogsaa, og da han kommer ind, saa kommer der et Karlfolk springende imod ham med Bugserne om H\u00e6lene. Han saa nu, det var en ung Kone, og saa t\u00e6nkte han: \u201dDether kommer a nok ogsaa skidt fra.\u201d Naa, saa kommer den gamle Mand ind. Saa siger hun: \u201dHvad var det for en Person, du viste her ind til mig, han vilde med Dj\u00e6vels Gevalt have v\u00e6ret \u00e6paa mig.\u201d \u201dJa, det kunde han da ikke vide.\u201d \u201dJo, det er sandt,\u201d siger hun, \u201d det var da saadan.\u201d Ja, saa skulde han arresteres, siger Manden, og der kom Bud efter Sognefogden, og der kom to M\u00e6nd til at sidde og passe paa Karlen. Hen ad Natten faldt de i S\u00f8vn, men Arrestanten sov ikke. Saa kommer der en til Vinduet, og han siger til ham: \u201dJa, i Morgen skal du jo kj\u00f8res til Herresfogden og i Forh\u00f8r.\u201d Ja, det skulde han vel. \u201dMen de tror ikke noget af det, du siger, de siger hele Tiden, det er L\u00f8gn. Men saa skal du sige: Det skal han bevidne, der gaar her inden for.\u201d Du kan se mig, men det kan de andre ikke, og saa skal a nok komme og sige det, som det er.\u201d Men ham, der havde v\u00e6ret paa Konen og kom med Bugserne om H\u00e6lene, det var netop deres Pr\u00e6st, og a tror saa galt han skulde hj\u00e6lpe Konen til Rette med at vidne for hende, nok er det, han var da med som Vidne. Naa, saa kommer Tiden, han skal i Forh\u00f8r, og de kommer saa derind paa Raadstuen. Karlen siger saa, idet han peger paa Pr\u00e6sten, at der var den Person, der kom imod ham med Bugserne om H\u00e6lene. De sagde jo, det var L\u00f8gn. Men saa siger Karlen: \u201dDet skal han vidne, der gaar her udenfor,\u201d om han maatte ikke have Lov at kalde ad ham. Jo, det maatte han godt. Karlen gaar saa hen til Vinduet og kalder paa ham og sp\u00f8rger, om han kan v\u00e6re Vidne til det, han sagde. Det sagde han jo til. Saa bandt baade Pr\u00e6sten og Konen Fanden tage sig paa, at det var L\u00f8gn, men saa tog denher fremmede Person den ene paa Armene og den anden paa Nakken, og saa rejste han af med dem, for det var jo Fanden selv. Saa kunde de skj\u00f8nne, det var sandt, Karlen sagde, og saa kunde han faa Lov til at gaa hans Vej. Han rejste saa videre af ad Hjemmet til. Kr\u00e6mmeren, som han havde fulgtes med den f\u00f8rste Dag, ham havde R\u00f8verne undlivet, og ham h\u00f8rer vi saa ikke mere til. Naa, saa kommer han endelig til Hjemmet, og Konen kjendte ham jo ikke. Han sp\u00f8rger, om han kunde ikke blive der. Ja-a, han kunde jo gj\u00e6rne blive, men hun havde ingen Steder at l\u00e6gge ham, for hun havde ikke uden en Seng. Ja, han kunde godt sidde paa en Stol om Natten, og han bliver der saa. Da det saa bliver ved Sengetid, gaar Konen til Sengs, og han s\u00e6tter sig paa Stolen. Saa kommer der en ung Person og l\u00e6gger sig ved Konen i Sengen. Hen ad Natten kommer der en til Vinduet og pikker paa og siger til Karlen\u2014og han kunde h\u00f8re, det var den samme, der f\u00f8r havde talt til ham: \u201dDen Person, der ligger, han har ligget ved din Kone hver Nat, siden du rejste, og dersom det var mig som dig, saa gik a hen og slog Hovedet i Stykker paa ham eller skar Halsen over paa ham.\u201d Ja, han bliver jo ogsaa opirret og var der henne og vilde have skaaret hans Hals over. Men saa kommer han i Tanker om, hvad hans Husbond havde sagt til ham, at han ikke maatte tage sig nogle Gjerninger for, som han ikke vidste var gode, inden han havde l\u00e6st hans Herrens B\u00f8n tre Gange, og saa gj\u00f8r han ogsaa det. Da vaagner Personen i det samme og siger: \u201dAa, Moder a dr\u00f8mte, min Fader var kommen her hjem og var her henne ved Sengen og vilde have skaaret Halsen over paa mig.\u201d \u2013 \u201dAa, din Fader,\u201d siger hun, \u201ddet er 18 Aar siden, a har set ham, han er nok d\u00f8d for l\u00e6nge siden.\u201d Det stod han jo og h\u00f8rte paa, og saa kunde han jo skj\u00f8nne, det var hans S\u00f8n, han vilde have undlivet. \u201dNej, a stedte ikke de Penge ilde, som a gav for det Raad,\u201d siger han, \u201dellers havde a jo skaaret Halsen over paa min egen S\u00f8n,\u201d og saa satte han sig stille hen i Stolen igjen, og ham uden for Vinduet han fik saa ingen Magt med det Raad han gav ham. Om Morgenen, da S\u00f8nnen kommer op, saa vilde Faderen have ham til at gaa hen og hente en P\u00e6gl til sig, og det gjorde han ogsaa, men saa vilde han ogsaa have ham til at drikke den med sig. Saa siger Moderen: \u201dNej, det maa han ikke, han skal hen og i hans Tjeneste, for han tjener om Dagen og ligger her hjemme om Natten.\u201d Saa sagde han dem, hvem han var, og de var jo sv\u00e6rt glade ved hverandre. Han fik saa Kagen frem, som han havde gaaet og baaret paa hele Vejen, og fik skaaret Hul paa den, og saa var der alle de Penge, han skulde have i L\u00f8n, alle de 300 Daler, de var bagt ind i Kagen. Saa lever de godt ved hverandre den Dag i Dag er, og det sidste a var der, da fik a skold \u00d8l paa en P\u00f8lse, og Skindet sidder paa min N\u00e6se endnu.", "english_publication": "A girl and a boy worked together at S\u00f8nder Tranders Hedeg\u00e5rd (Heath farm), and it was a couple of humble people they worked for there. These people's pensioners were dead, and the pensioners' house stood vacant. Then the farmhand goes and seduces the girl. She goes to the husband and tells him how things were and asks him if she could have permission to stay there in the pensioners' house and have the child, because her beloved wanted to drive the cattle to Holsten , and it was in the spring he was to leave, that was the custom in the old days. She gets permission to do that, but the farmhand and the girl get married before he left. But the child was born before that and it was a boy, and it was also brought to the church since they had gotten married right away. Well, he went off . When he gets to Holsten and had gotten rid of the cattle, he stayed up there and started to work for a man there. The man didn\u2019t want to pay him any wages before he saw how he was and how they hit it off with each other. Well, this cattle driver was happy with that as well. One week after another went by, and the man offered him nothing, and the farmhand didn\u2019t ask for anything either except for what he needed, he got that, and they went on like that for eighteen years and he stayed there as if he was their own child. Then he says to the man one day: \u201cTomorrow I want to go home and see my wife and my son.\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat, you\u2019re married?\u201d says the man. Yes, he was, and now he\u2019d decided that he wanted to go home, since he missed it. \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll have us a happy day today,\u201d says the man, and they sat down to celebrate. The man had put all the farmhand's wages together and he wanted to give them to him and it amounted to three hundred daler, that was big money in the old days. So they\u2019re sitting there and talking and drinking and then the man says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a long journey ahead of you, and if you\u2019ll give me a hundred daler, I\u2019ll give you a good piece of advice that will serve you well.\u201d Sure, he\u2019d gladly do that, and they make the deal. The advice was that he must not take any shortcuts, but should follow the true country road. Then they had a few more drams, and then the farmer says: \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me another hundred daler, then I\u2019ll give you another piece of advice.\u201d Sure, he\u2019d go along with that. \u201cYou must not take lodgings where the fox builds over the raven, because things will go bad for you there.\u201d The farmhand keeps drinking with the man so long that he winds up giving him all his money back, and then he was to have one final piece of advice, and that was he must not take lodgings where there was a very old husband and a young wife, because things would go bad for him there. And then he wanted to give him another piece of good advice as a bonus, and that was that he shouldn\u2019t do any deed that he wasn\u2019t sure was a good deed before he had said the Lord\u2019s prayer three times. Then the man\u2019s wife says, \u201cYes, now our father has wasted your time today, but I want to waste a bit of your time tomorrow, since I\u2019m going to bake and you are going to get a nice cake along with you on your trip.\u201d He got the nice cake and the wife told him that he must not cut into it before he got home and if his wife was dead then he was to come back and give the cake back. He promised her that and then he left. The first day he was out on his journey, he came to a peddler and followed along with him because they were going the same way. Then they come to a forest and then the peddler says: \u201cThere\u2019s a road through here, which is much shorter than the country road.\u201d He thinks a bit about this, but then he says no, he wants to follow the country road. But the peddler wants to go the other way, and so they split up there. When the peddler had gotten a little ways into the forest, he begins to shout and scream because robbers had come after him. Then the farmhand thought to himself: \u201cI didn\u2019t waste that money that I paid for the first piece of good advice.\u201d He comes a little later to an isolated house in the forest and since it had become evening, he goes up there and asks for lodgings. He could certainly stay there. As they sit there eating dinner that night, there\u2019s an old man sitting at the table with red hair and a black beard. Then the farmhand thinks: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to turn out well for me.\u201d There was a girl who was to show him up to a room upstairs, and then she says: \u201cI feel bad for you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d he says. \u201cWell, the robbers aren\u2019t home, this is a robbers\u2019 den you\u2019ve come to, and there\u2019s no one here but the old guy you sat and ate with and talked to. When they come home, they\u2019ll kill you. But there\u2019s a piece of rope hanging here, let me tie it around you, then you can let yourself down out the window and down to the ground.\u201d He thanked her and took the rope, and then he hoisted himself down and went away from there and got away. He keeps going that night and the next day he comes to stay at another farm. There was an old man out in the courtyard and he went over to him and asked if he couldn\u2019t have lodgings. Sure, he certainly could. He could go inside to his wife and then he\u2019d come in himself, when he was done mucking out. He went in, too, and, when he gets inside, another man comes running toward him with his pants around his heels. He saw now that there was a young wife there and then he thought: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to turn out well for me either.\u201d Then the old man comes in. Then she says: \u201cWhat kind of a person was that you sent in to me, he wanted to get up on top of me like the devil.\u201d Well, he couldn\u2019t have known that. \u201cWell, that\u2019s true,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s how it was.\u201d Well, then he was to be arrested, says the man, and they sent for the parish bailiff, and two men came to sit and watch the farmhand. During the night, they fell asleep but the prisoner didn\u2019t sleep. Then someone comes to the window, and says to the farmhand: \"Well, tomorrow you are going to be driven to the district bailiff and be tried.\" Yes, he certainly was. \u201cBut they won\u2019t believe anything you say, they\u2019ll say the whole time it is a lie. But then you are to say: The one walking outside here shall witness to that. You can see me, but the others can\u2019t, and then I\u2019ll come and tell it like it is. The one who had been on top of the wife and came running out with his pants around his heels, that was their minister, and I doubt that he\u2019ll help out the wife by witnessing for her, it will be enough that he is there as a witness.\" Well then the time comes, he is to be tried, and they go in there to the courtroom. The farmhand says, as he points at the minister, that he was the one who came at him with his pants around his heels. They said that was a lie. But then the farmhand says: \u201cHe will witness to it, the one who is walking outside,\u201d couldn\u2019t he be allowed to call him? Well, yes he was allowed to. The farmhand goes over to the window and calls to him and asks if he can witness to what he had said. He said yes to that. Then the minister and the wife swore for the devil to take them, it was a lie, but then this stranger took one under one arm and the other by the neck and then he went off with them, because it was the devil himself. Then they could see that it was true what the farmhand had said, and then he was given permission to go on his way. He went along on his way home. The peddler whom he had accompanied the first day had been killed by the robbers and we don\u2019t hear anymore about him. Well, then he finally gets home and his wife didn\u2019t recognize him. He asks if he can\u2019t stay there. Well, he could stay, but she had no place for him to lie because she only had one bed. Well, he could sit in a chair at night, and so he stays there. When it gets to be bedtime, the wife goes to bed and he sits down in the chair. Then a young man comes in and lies down by the wife in the bed. During the night, someone comes to the window and raps on it and says to the farmhand--and he can hear that it was the same person who had spoken to him before: \u201cThat person who is lying there has lain with your wife every night since you left, and if it were me, I\u2019d go over and knock his head off or cut his throat.\u201d Well, he gets provoked, too, and went over there and was going to cut his throat. But then he remembers what his master had said to him, that he mustn\u2019t do any deed that he didn\u2019t know was good before he had said the Lord\u2019s prayer three times, and so he did that, too. Then the person wakes up at once and says: \u201cOh mother, I dreamed that my father had come home and was here by the bed and wanted to cut my throat.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, your father,\u201d she says, \u201cit is eighteen years since I\u2019ve seen him, he probably died a long time ago.\u201d He stood and listened to that, and then he could easily figure out that it was his son that he was about to kill. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t waste the money that I paid for that advice,\u201d he says, \u201cotherwise I would have cut my own son\u2019s throat,\u201d and then he sat down quietly in the chair again, and the one outside the window gained no power with the advice he\u2019d given him. The next morning, when the son gets up, the father wants him to go and get a half pint for him and he did that, too, but then he wanted him to drink it with him, too. Then the mother says: \u201cNo, he may not, he has to go to his work, because he works during the day and lies here at night.\u201d Then he told them who he was and they were very happy with each other. He took the cake out that he had been carrying the whole way and cut into it and then all the money that he was to have in wages, all three hundred daler, had been baked into the cake. So they live happily together even to this very day, and the last time I was there, I got scalded beer on a sausage and the sausage skin is still sitting on my nose."}, {"story_id": 68, "full_name": "150 - 3.05 - Unpub_BJK_305", "publication_info": "Unpub_BJK_305", "annotation": "This short phrase refers to the peddler who is assaulted by the robbers in the forest in the previous story (BJK 3.05).

I think that he'd been in league with some people there in the forest and had fled from them. Then he wanted to go in there and hide and stay there the night. Then he sees an old hag who is standing there with a young woman and is putting a necklace on her neck and she said that she had a pain in her neck. It hurt in the front and it hurt in the back and it was a horrible pain she had. This young woman was then to come and serve him and she wrote on the table, look out for me, I'm going to come again, and she served him with wine that had a sleeping potion in it but she threw it down onto the ground and then she said: That's right, my lord, drink it all, we have more. It pleased her, that he would drink so much. Everything so that the hag wouldn't notice anything. She gave him a note explaining how everything was to go. Then he settled down and he put a dead body in the bed. Then when they'd come home, the old hag was to light a light for them. Then the master of the fort who'd opened up for him, came and he was to stab him to death, but then the knight was standing behind the door with his sword drawn. When they came home, they'd taken a maiden in the forest, they had gotten a hold of her and she was his sweetheart, and then they'd eaten and gotten so drunk that it was frightening. The old hag's son had always had the first girl as a night friend, but now he wanted to have the new one instead. He bet 1000 devils with each one over who was to have her, the one felt he had more right to her than the next. The first girl sneaked out with a light and was going to check to see if he was asleep and she came back and said that he was sleeping now. So the fort master was to go and stab him to death. He went in there and shoved his dagger into him. That was well placed, said the old hag, it made such a deep \"oh\" sound. Then the knight came out and chopped off the head first of the fort master and then the hag but he didn't harm the girl. Then she ran in to the strongest of the men and said that he should go in and talk to the master and he came and stuck his head in the door and said some drivel, while the knight lashed out and his last words rolled across the floor. There was one named Daniel, and she asked for him. She had often seen him sitting crying in a corner with his wine because he had to be a robber. He was so strong. Then she called to him, he should come. When he came he put the sword right up to his chest, but didn't harm him. He said that now the holy woman [saved him] had kept her word, because he'd dreamed that a holy woman had saved him from this prison. Then he took a chair and broke the back off of it and went with that and killed all of them, because they were all so drunk. When he'd killed the fort master and the hag, he had gone to a place where the lord was, and he heard from inside there a hoarse woman's voice say: Yes, you have my life but you will never get my honor. Then he knocked down the door and went in and killed him. They were all killed all except for this Daniel. He put him in charge of it (the fort).

Saa listede den f\u00f8rste Pige sig ud med Lys og sagde, hun skulde hen at se, om den fremmede sov, og hun kom igjen og sagde: Nu sov han godt. Saa skulde Bargfogden hen og stikke ham ihjel, det var ham, der havde lukket ham ind, og den gamle Kj\u00e6lling var med, hun skulde jo lyse for ham. Han gaar saa hen til Sengen og jager hans Dolk i ham. \u201dDet var godt truffet,\u201d sagde den gamle Kj\u00e6lling, det gav saadan et dybt Ak.

It also resonates with folktales in which husbands are duped by their wives and lovers (see ATU 1355, \"The Man Hidden under the Bed\").\n\n    As with BJK 1.22, Tang Kristensen based his main published version on a concatenation of collected variants, noting, \"Alle de af mig indsamlede 12 opskrifter af visen (eller brudstykker deraf) har jeg sammenarbejdet til f\u00f8lgende opskrift\" [I have combined the twelve recordings of this ballad (or fragments of it) that I have collected into the following recording] (Kristensen DSk, 154). Fortunately, Tang Kristensen also included Jens's version in unedited form. There is a significant difference in length between Jens's version and the concatenated version presented at the end of this annotation. Tang Kristensen did not delete the obscene reference from the published version but did offer an alternate ending that substitutes crafts for the three children--mirroring the three crafts in the tale--rather than criminal behavior and execution. Jens, in his variant, ends his song with the miller's wife sinking into the mill stream. \n\n     The concatenated version reads as follows:\n\nThe cobbler and tailor hatched a plan,\nthey wanted to go to the miller\u2019s daughter\n\nThe cobbler stuffed the tailor into a sack\nand carried him off to the mill stream\n\nThe cobbler carried the tailor to the mill dam,\nand there stood the miller damming the water\n\nAnd when he came to the mill bridge,\nthere stood the miller in his silver buckled shoes\n\n\u201cAnd listen miller, both fair and fine,\ncan you mill my grain without charging me?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, dear farmer, what is in your sack,\nthat you want to forbid me my fee?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn top is barley, and on the bottom is wheat,\nand the little mice really want to eat that.\n\nIn the sack there is both barley and wheat,\nand where can I put it, where it will be safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll store your mill sack\nso it will be protected from rats and mice.\n\nPut it up in my mill loft\ntomorrow I will mill it as fine as dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t put my bag in your loft,\nbecause rats and mice could eat it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then put it by our daughter\u2019s bed,\nthere aren\u2019t any mice running there.\u201d\n\nLate at night, when the dew it fell,\nthe sack began to crawl and walk.\n\n\u201cAnd listen, dear father, light a candle,\nI think there are thieves in our house.\u201d\n\nThen he patted her on her snowwhite cheek\n\u201cBe quiet, it is your beloved.\u201d\n\nShe shouted: \u201cDear father, blow out the candle,\nit was only a cat that caught a mouse.\u201d\n\nThe old hag woke up in the corner:\n\u201cI think the cat has boots on.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, you hag, in the corner you lay,\ntomorrow you\u2019re going out into the mill stream.\n\nShut up you hag, or you\u2019ll be shamed,\ntomorrow your going into the mill pond.\u201d\n\nEarly in the morning that tailor he got up,\nhe tossed the hag into the mill pond\u2019s high water\n\nYes, the miller he stood on the driest land,\nthe hag lay out in the water and sang.\n\nThe hag sank, and the sack floated,\nand all of her flour turned into porridge.\n\nYes, it wasn\u2019t strange that the hag was heavy,\nsince her cunt and ass weighed a hundred pounds.\n\nThe miller with his thick waist\nwas afraid he was going to lose his life.\n\nThe miller he had such a crooked tooth\nhe hooked that into the hag and pulled her to land.\n\nThat\u2019s what our daughter got for the mouse\u2019s walk,\nshe got two cradles by her bed.\n\nThere stood cradles by her bed,\nthe one was a girl and the other a boy.\n\nAnd they grew up, and got so big,\nthe one became a thief and the other became a whore.\n\nThe one was hanged, and the other was burned\n-Tyrilus out in l\u00f6ndum\nand there my ballad has an end.\n-Since tonight we were so merry.\n\nAnother ending is not so bad and a bit more innocent:\n\nIt went on for five months\nOur miller\u2019s daughter became uncomfortable\n\nYes, it went on for nine months,\nshe gave birth to two sons, had one more, and it was three\n\nThey stayed there for eighteen years,\nYou better believe they were happy in the miller\u2019s farm\n\nThe one became a cobbler, the other became a smith,\nit went so bad, they had one who became a tailor", "danish_manuscript": "Skr\u00e6dderen og Skomageren [de] makkede et Raad\nom hvem af dem M\u00f8llerens Datter kunde faa.\n--\nSkr. nu putt.

Among the reforms that came with the constitution in 1849 was a prohibition on the use of corporal punishment on tenants. \n\n     In this story, the capricious nature of Speitzer's punishments and the harsh demands of villeinage lead to the peasants' assault on him. Unlike other stories of cruel manor lords, the punishment in Jens's story does not take a supernatural form, such as being carried away by the devil  (JPP 2.05), a motif that does appear in other variants describing Speitzer's death (JAH II 254). Instead, the punishment is utterly of this world and verges on being a small scale peasant revolt. The story of Speitzer's beating is also mentioned in other stories (JAH II 254 and 255), and in their description, they emphasize that the assailants crushed Speitzer's right hand between two stones. \n\n     Jens's story about Speitzer is more elaborate than many other variants. He expands the story to include the apparent escape of at least one of the assailants. The little child nearly reveals the hiding place of the hidden assailant, but the child's speech is confusing enough that the scouts do not discover him. Hiding the assailant suggests a conspiracy among the peasants to protect their own against a fundamentally unjust system. The unjustness of the manor farm system, of course, lay at the root of the constitutional reforms of 1849; this story stands in part as one about the \"bad old days,\" and the resourcefulness of the peasants in the face of that system.\n\n     In the second part of the story, Jens returns his focus to Speitzer, and relates another incident that emphasizes Speitzer's arrogance and his cruelty. His refusal to confess to the minister underscores his unwillingness to be part of the (human) community. The lecherous manor lord is a motif found in other stories of cruel manor lords as well (PJ 2.01).\n\n     Other stories suggest that Speitzer owned Aggersborgg\u00e5rd, V\u00e5r and \u00d8rndrup. These three large holdings form a triangle with Aggersborgg\u00e5rd in the northwest, V\u00e5r twelve kilometers to the east, and \u00d8rndrup seventeen kilometers to the south. \u00d8rndrup is approximately twenty-four kilometers west of Ersted. When Speitzer offers one of the farms to Per Skytte, it is implicit that it is one of these three farms. Early records indicate that the Speitzer family owned Aggersborgg\u00e5rd during that period, and that Mads Speitzer was the oldest son of Christen Madsen Speitzer (d. 2.5.1767) and Anna Margrethe Lund. Tang Kristensen normalizes the spelling from Speisser in the manuscript to Speitzer in the published version, basing his spelling on other stories about the manor lord.", "danish_manuscript": "En der Per Skytte og Kr\u00e6n Gatten de sprakede\nSpeisser[s] alle hans Sideben i Stykker.

The next day, when Kr\u00e6n Gatten was at the farm doing his villeinage, and they were raking and they\u2019d finished harvesting, he stayed back a little bit, so that Speisser would come over to him. It was down in a little depression in the field. Then Speisser comes over and says, \u201cListen, Kr\u00e6sten, can you give me a light?\u201d Then he asked him, \u201cI\u2019ll give you hell. What did you do to my brother yesterday?\u201d He began to lash out at him with his staff and said, \u201cYeah, you can get some too, my good man.\u201d Then he [Kristen] jumped on him but he couldn\u2019t knock him over and then along comes Per Skytte and he [Kr\u00e6n Gatten] says, \u201cIf you\u2019re a brave guy, then you\u2019ll help me.\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo, help me,\u201d said Speisser, \u201cthen I\u2019ll give you one of my manor farms.\u201d His hat had come off and he was bald, Speisser was. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d says Per Skytte and he smashed his rake down on his head, so that blood poured out of him, and then they knocked him out cold and then they stood on either side of him and kicked him on both sides and broke all his ribs. And when he stopped moving, they thought that he was dead. Then they ran off, but at that moment he lifted his head. \u201cHaven\u2019t you had enough yet? We\u2019ll give you some more,\u201d and they took a stone and put his right hand on it and took another stone and smashed his hand with it. Then they each took a horse and rode off. \n    Then scouts were sent out to find them. They also got so close to them, they came to a place where one of them was, it was probably Skytten. They had a little baby, who was crawling about on the floor, and when they came in there to search, they put him into a closet.

Dagen efter, da Kr\u00e6n Gatten var til hove, og de havde oph\u00f6stet og gik og rev, holdt han sig noget tilbage, for det Speitzer skulde komme hen til ham. Det var s\u00e5dan i en lavning.

The next day, when Kr\u00e6n Gatten was at the farm doing his villeinage, and they\u2019d harvested and they were raking, he stayed back a little bit, so that Speitzer would come over to him.

Speitzer\u2019s hat had come off, and he was bald, and Per smashed his rake down on his head, so that blood poured out of him, and then they knocked him out cold and stood on either side of him and kicked him on both sides and broke all his ribs. Now they thought that Speitzer was dead when he stopped moving and then they started to run off. But at the same time he lifted his head. \u201cHaven\u2019t you had enough yet?\u201d they said, \u201cyou\u2019ll get some more,\u201d and so they took a stone and put his right hand on it and took another stone and smashed his hand with it.

Then the family where he was hiding put him into a closet. They had a little baby, who was on the floor, and when the scouts came in there to search, the little child goes and says, \u201cMan in the cave, man in the cave,\u201d but they didn\u2019t really understand and the mother took the child and got it out of the way, so they didn\u2019t find him.

The capriciousness of his punishments and the callousness of his actions resonate with the previous story of the cruel manor lord (BJK 3.13). That Tejl commits suicide--an act closely linked to Satan--is not terribly surprising, given stories that tell not only of Satan coming to get a cruel, high status peasant-tormentor but also of him convincing people to commit suicide.\n\n     The position of birkedommer, or independent district judge, was a position closely connected to manor farms. The birk was a jurisdiction sanctioned by the crown and independent from the district. Control of a birk allowed a manor lord and his appointed magistrates a great degree of power over the administration of the peasants who lived on the estate. The establishment of these independent judicial districts ended in 1809, and they were eliminated in 1849, insuring a more even-handed and consistent national approach to the courts and justice. Nevertheless, it was not until 1919 that the title of \"birkedommer\" was eliminated.\n\n     In Tang Kristensen's field diary, the last story was separated from the rest of the record by a small line, an indication that Tang Kristensen interpreted it as a separate story.

Here, the tailor is described as unusually shy around women to the extent that he even refuses to measure them.\n\n     Labeling the tailor a beggar is somewhat unfair, since his possession of the poor board indicates clearly that his assistance was being supervised by the local authorities.   Prior to reforms in the poverty assistance laws in 1803, the most common form of care for the poor was \"omgangsfors\u00f8rgelsen\" [revolving assistance]. Under this system, a person was assigned to a series of farms, and they would go from one farm to the next listed on their stakkelsfj\u00e6l (poor board) to receive help  (J\u00f8rgensen 1940 (1979), 10-11). After the land reforms of the late 1780s and the subsequent physical relocation of farms out onto the newly apportioned fields, the system was no longer sustainable since the distances between farms had become quite large. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, revolving assistance had been replaced by direct assistance, both in kind and monetary assistance, and the establishment of poor houses and, later, poor farms.\n\n   \n     The lengths to which Hjorde-Jens and then Truukr\u00e6n go to avoid paying for the tailor's burial are morbidly comical. In that sense, the story parallels folktales in which corpses are posed to look like the living (PJ 1.02).The cost of burying those receiving poor help accrued to the local parish board, and not to the individual farmer who happened to be housing the person at the time of their death (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). The story is apocryphal: since Jens apparently knew Truukr\u00e6n, the events described here cannot have happened earlier than the 1820s, even though the system of assistance described here ended in the first decades of the century (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 11).\n\n     The manuscript makes no distinction between the preceding story and this one. In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen changed the order of events, describing the tailor's death first. He also editorialized on Jens's performance of the story, noting: \"It was quite funny to hear my informant pronounce the tailor's Jutish sentences, since he comes from \u00c5restrup and always uses \"w\" in his speech, used \"v\" here to make it clear that the tailor was from Rold, where they use that sound.\" Although Tang Kristensen was primarily commenting on differences in local pronunciation, he inadvertently provided helpful information concerning the performance of the story. Because of this note, one can more easily imagine Jens switching voices and even speech patterns as he told the story, particularly when relating direct speech.", "danish_manuscript": "Naar en Tigger havde gaaet \nher i Byen omkring og kr\u00e6vet, s. skulde de kj\u00f8re\ndem til n\u00e6rmeste By.

Each town had their own \"poor board.\" There was an old tailor from Rold who died at our neighbor's house, and the man who lived in the farm to the west he was an alderman. Now, the town in which he died had to pay for his burial. The tailor was the brother of the parish bailiff in Rold, and he went around sewing for people, but by the end he just went about begging, they called him the Rold Tailor, he was shy around women. At one place, he was sitting on the table sewing and the children were standing on the floor rocking a baby, while their mother was out milking at the moment, and they tipped over the cradle and it landed on top of the baby. But the tailor wasn't man enough to go over and help the little baby up, because it was a girl. When the mother came back in she said, \"Couldn't you have done the baby a favor and picked the cradle up, it could have lain there and suffocated?\" But he answered, \"Nah, I won't mess with that shit, no sirree. If that shit had been a boy, then it would have been a totally different story.\" Kold-Jen's old mother wanted him to sew a dress for her, and she wanted him to measure her. But he answered, \"Get out of here, I can make it fit you.\" She wanted it to be a bit nice and pretty and she stood and wriggled her shoulders. But he said, \"Get out of here,\" and he didn't want to touch her. He could get all the town's dogs to follow along behind him in a line and he patted them and called out to them, \"Are you coming over here, my friend, you are my only friend in the world. Do you remember the time I helped you out when you'd stolen all those wonderful herrings, I knew it, but I didn't say anything.\" Then he lay there and died at Hjorde-Jens's, and then he went over to Old Per, that was his neighbor, and he got him to help him carry him out and they placed him up next to a stone wall that was pretty tall, and tied his bag on him, and put his staff in his hand. It was early in the morning, before dawn. When daylight came, Hjorde-Jens came out and found him there and went over to the alderman, they called him Truukr\u00e6n, and told him that. \"Well,\" he says, \"that's really bad,\" and he told his farmhand that he should harness the two gray horses to a dung wagon and go over and get him and then they drove him over to Rold over to the parish bailiff's farm. \"I've brought your brother,\" said Truukr\u00e6n, \"he's dead.\" Well, then they could take him with them again, and bury him. But then Truukr\u00e6n jumped off the wagon and took hold of the one dung board and Byrri-Niels took hold of the other, and then they dumped the tailor out of the wagon with his bag, and his basket and his things, and he fell down onto the ground, and then they jumped back up into the wagon and rode off.

This happened early in the morning, before daylight, and when it became daylight, Hjorde-Jens came out and found him \u2013 at least it was supposed to appear that way \u2013 and he went to the alderman, they called him Truukr\u00e6n, and told him about the Rold tailor, how it was. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s really bad.\u201d He told his farmhand that he should harness the two gray horses to the dung wagon and drive off and get him. Then they drove him over to Rold and into the parish bailiff\u2019s farm. \u201cI\u2019ve brought your brother,\u201d said Truukr\u00e6n, \u201che\u2019s dead.\u201d Well, the parish bailiff said, then they could take him back with them, and bury him. But then Truukr\u00e6n jumped off the wagon and took hold of the one dung board and Byrri-Niels, who was with him, took hold of the other, and then they dumped the tailor out of the wagon with his bag, and his basket and his things, so that he fell down onto the ground, and then they jumped back up into the wagon and rode off. When they got to Try lake, they could hear that the drum was being beaten in Rold, so that the men could gather and talk about what they should do with the tailor. \n     This here tailor went around sewing for people, but in the end he went around begging. He was shy with women. One place, he was sitting on the table sewing and the children were standing on the floor rocking a baby, while their mother was just out milking, and they tipped over her cradle and it landed on top of the baby. But the tailor wasn\u2019t man enough to go over and help the little baby up, because it was a girl. When the mother came back in she said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have done the baby a favor and picked the cradle up, it could have lain there and suffocated?\u201d But he answered, \u201cNah, I won\u2019t mess with that shit, no sirree. If it had been a boy, then it would have been a totally different story.\u201d Kold-Jen\u2019s old mother wanted him to sew a dress for her, and then he was supposed to measure her. But he answered, \u201cGet out of here, I can make it fit her.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to touch her. The same tailor could get all the town\u2019s dogs to follow along behind him in a line. He talked well with them and patted them while he said, \u201cAre you coming over here, my friend, you are my only friend in the world. Do you remember the time I helped you out when you\u2019d stolen all those wonderful herrings, I knew it, but I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d"}, {"story_id": 82, "full_name": "150 - 3.19 - JAT_VI_796", "publication_info": "JAT_VI_796", "annotation": "In the manuscript, this notation appears in the middle of the story, just after the reported direct speech of the tailor to the dogs, and just before he dies.

After 1873, the Danish monetary system was aligned with that of Norway and Sweden, with the \"krone\" or crown as the main currency. This currency was based on the gold standard. The new system was a decimal system (as opposed to one based on 12) and consisted of crowns and \u00f8re. Prior to the reform, two systems, the \"courant\" and the \"specie,\" based on a silver standard, were used. \n\nThe \"rigsdaler\" used from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries was similar to the currency in use at the time in Holland, German and Sweden. The Danish currency system, first instituted in 1625, and reformed after the financial crisis in 1813, had the following equivalents: \n12 penning = 1 skilling\n16 skilling = 1 mark\n6 mark = 1 rigsdaler or daler (sometimes referred to in English as the \"rixdollar\")\n8 mark = 1 krone\nIn 1873, the rigsdaler was set as equivalent to two crowns. \nThe word \"daler\" is a shortened form of the name of a Czech silver coin, the Joachimstaler from 1518.\n", "danish_manuscript": "Dg. br\u00e6ndte de s. meget Kul og solgte det og\nAsken til Aalborg.

Pr\u00e6sten blev helt forbavset over dether og gik nu og var kun et halvt Menneske. Men saa kommer han i Snak med Byhyrden, der sagde, at hvis Pr\u00e6sten vilde give ham nye Kl\u00e6der og Rejsepenge, saa vilde han rejse over til Kj\u00f8benhavn og m\u00f8de for ham hos Kongen. Ja, det vilde han med Forn\u00f8jelse, og saa rejste hyrden. Da han nu kommer ind for Kongen, sidder denne paa en Guldstol. Kongen sp\u00f8rger ham f\u00f8rst, hvad den Stol er v\u00e6rd. \"Aa, den er ikke mere v\u00e6rd, end en god Majmaaneds Regn kan betale\", siger Hyrden. \"Jamen hvad er jeg saa v\u00e6rd?\" \u2014 \"Ja, de gav jo tredive S\u00f8lvpenge for vor Frelser, naar man saa giver 29 for Majest\u00e6ten, saa kan De vel v\u00e6re betalt.\" \u2014 \"Naaja, men hvad t\u00e6nker jeg paa?\" \u2014 \"Ja, Kongen t\u00e6nker, De snakker med Rold pr\u00e6st, men saa er det deres Byhyrde.\" Saadan slap han godt fra det.", "english_publication": "The minister in Rold wrote over his door that he lived without sorrow or adversity. One time, the king came through there and when he saw that inscription he said to the minister that he was to come to an audience with him and answer three questions, otherwise, if he couldn\u2019t, he was to kiss the blue virgin. The first question was what the king\u2019s chair was worth, the second, what he himself was worth, and the third, what he was thinking. The minister was quite surprised by this and went about and was only half a person with worry. But then he falls into conversation with the town shepherd who said that if the minister would give him some new clothes and some traveling money, then he\u2019d travel over to Copenhagen and meet with the king in his stead. Yes, he\u2019d gladly do that and then the shepherd journeyed off. When he comes in to the king, the king is sitting on a gold chair. The king asks him first what the chair is worth. \u201cOh, it isn\u2019t worth more than what a good May rain can pay,\u201d says the shepherd. \u201cWell then what am I worth?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, they paid thirty silver coins for our savior, so if you paid twenty-nine for your majesty, then you\u2019ve been well paid for.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOK, then what am I thinking about?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, the king is thinking that you\u2019re talking to Rold Minister, but in fact it is their town shepherd.\u201d That\u2019s how he got out of it well."}, {"story_id": 106, "full_name": "150 - 3.43 - Unpub_BJK_343", "publication_info": "Unpub_BJK_343", "annotation": "Jens's humor, and delight in amusing verbal juxtapositions comes through in this short, unpublished statement of the woman's response to her cow's desire.

In this story, the parish clerk plays a prank on the minister, highlighting the perceived tension that existed between the parish clerk and the minister. The minister, caught off guard, loses his most important possession, first to the soup pot and then to the dog. The story also plays on the motif of the devil in dog form (Woods 1958), but this dog is hardly Satanic. \n\n     The minister's amusing sermon to the parish relies on the common formulation \"falde til F\u00f8je og Takke,\" [submit and be thankful], but adds the absurd proposition that God's words are found in a dog's behind, a literal representation of what had happened but utterly incomprehensible--in fact blasphemous--in the context of a sermon. In that sense, the Rold minister's statement is reminiscent of the minister who described the antics of a runaway cow during a funeral (JPP 1.03).\n\n     This story is broken up in the manuscript, appearing unexpectedly after the episode in the preceding storyin which the shepherd agrees to stand in for the minister in Rold (BJK 3.42). It is likely that Jens digressed from his original story to tell this story, and then picked up with the shepherd confronting the king.

Here, the post officer uses the normal phrasing of the minister in legends of the would-be ghost (ML3005) when he confronts the prone figure of the priest. In those stories, the lack of response leads to the minister conjuring the farmhand. Here, the post officer with the same intentions as the minister in ML3005 to consign the devil to the realm of the dead takes aim with his rifle but the gun conveniently jams. The amusingly positive outcome is attributed to divine intervention.\n\n     The second part of the story plays on the concept of the minister speaking directly to the minister. Here, the minister, apparently slow on the uptake, wonders to whom the Lord is speaking, as Per is a common name (short for Peder or Peter).\n\n     Tang Kristensen provided a historical annotation in the published version, noting that P.T. Karmark was minister in Rold from 1721-1750. His successor was also named Karmark (S. P. Karmark), although it is unclear if there was a familial relationship between the two.

Personal property and personal initiative to prosecute torts had become concerns of people far down the social ladder; prior to these reforms, few people had any real or personal property to protect. The rogue's clever reply to the claimants, both in the first case and in the second case (against the minister), clearly form the narrative crux of these accounts. This emphasis on oratorical skill appears frequently in Jens's stories.\n\n     The second part of the story dealing with the falling out between the minister and the rogue, and the subsequent court case, incorporates an element of sex--something that appears frequently in many of Jens's other stories and songs. The rogue's initial criticism of the minister and his stupidity, comparing him to the horse for slipping into a \"hole\", leads to their confrontation in court. There, the rogue plays the minister for a fool, relying again on double entendres and imprecise information to score a rhetorical victory.\n\n     The recording in the manuscript is confusing. For the sake of readability, I have marked the section that actually appears at the end of the manuscript record in brackets.

Is he the one who was to meet up for the minister. Yes, he was. Why did he wait so long? Yes, please excuse him, he had a barrel of boiled peas and he absolutely had to get them planted. \"What? Cooked peas can't grow.\" \"Oh yeah.\" They began reading up the case to him. \"Permission to ask a question, weren't the eggs prepared, boiled or fried?\" Yes, they were boiled. \"You said that boiled peas couldn't grow, how could you get chicks from boiled eggs?\" Yes, they had to admit that that couldn't happen. Well you're welcome to reach an agreement with the minister, because otherwise they'd have him to deal with. So they had to give money to the minister instead. Then a while passed and he and the minister were great friends, but then they had a falling out, him and the minister.

Then the minister asks if he has something on his conscience and it would be for the best ... Yes he did, he had taken life from his first wife. Lord save us. Had he done anything else? Yes, he had screwed seven dogs to death. The minister heard him out. Then he got better, the rogue did, and then they were going to start their case. The rogue was a fine upstanding person and he'd [never hurt anyone. \"What did you admit to me when you were sick?\" Yes, he hadn't done anything to be ashamed over.

So that was the life he'd taken. Then there were these dogs. His dog had had seven puppies and they lay under the bed. Then he'd fucked his wife and the bottom of the bed had fallen out, and they had crushed all the puppies to death. That's what had happened.

Se, Pr\u00e6sten han h\u00f8rte jo ud. \"Ja, du er en forf\u00e6rdelig Synder, du maa se at omvende dig, det er paa Tiden, hvis der da er Omvendelse for saadan en Synder.\" Saa kom han sig igjen, det gjorde Skalken, han havde jo slet ikke v\u00e6ret syg. En Tid efter rider han ned til Pr\u00e6sten med hans Br\u00f8drug, men kom for n\u00e6r til et V\u00e6ldhul, og der slapper \u00d8get i for ham. Aaret efter red han den samme Vej paa det samme \u00d8g, og da kunde han ikke komme n\u00e6r om ved det hul. Saa sagde han, at \u00d8get var klogere end deres Pr\u00e6st. Det fik Pr\u00e6sten at h\u00f8re, og saa sags\u00f8gte han ham for det. Da de skal nu til at begynde deres Proces, saa siger Skalken, at han havde aldrig gjort ham nogen Fortr\u00e6d eller sagt nogen L\u00f8gn om ham. \"Hvad har du da bekjendt for mig, da du var syg?\" Ja, han havde ikke gjort noget, han beh\u00f8vede at skamme sig ved. Pr\u00e6sten bliver ved at praje ham, og han siger saa, hvordan det har sig.  Det var saa forf\u00e6rdelig ondt Vejr, og hans Kone Skulde gj\u00f8re Barsel, men de kunde ikke faa Jordemoder, og saa gjorde han det selv ud. Det var det Liv, han havde taget. Det var nu det, men saa begynder Pr\u00e6sten at tale om den anden Forbrydelse, han havde begaaet. Hans hund havde faaet Syv hvalpe, og de laa under Sengen. Saa havde han en Nat ...... hans Kone, og da Slap Bunden af Sengen, og de havde klemt alle hvalpene ihjel. Saadan var det gaaet til. Saa maa Pr\u00e6sten til at tage fat paa den Beskyldning, at hans gamle \u00d8g var klogere end Pr\u00e6sten. Ja, Skalken begynder saa med at fort\u00e6lle, at han var saadan et oprigtigt Menneske, og nu var han da n\u00f8dt til at fort\u00e6lle det, som det var. Pr\u00e6sten havde lokket en af hans piger og var kommen i en slem Forlegenhed for at blive fri for at kaldes Faaer. Men Aaret efter lokkede han Pigen anden Gang. Om Dommeren tykte saa ikke, han havde haft Ret i at sige, at Pr\u00e6sten ikke var saa klog som \u00d8get, da han var kommen i ..... anden Gang. Det maatte Dommeren give ham Ret i. Endelig vilde han sige, at det, Pr\u00e6sten havde f\u00f8rt frem for Retten, det var noget, han ellers ikke maatte aabenbare, og nu forlangte han, at Dommeren Skulde domme ham fra hans Embede for det. Det skete ogsaa, saa Skalken var ikke saa nem at tr\u00e6kkes med.", "english_publication": "The \"Rogue from Mjels\" was a farm owner who lived there in Mjels. One time he saved their minister, who\u2019d run into really bad difficulties. In his day he\u2019d attended the Latin school in Aalborg, and there he\u2019d gone into a restaurant and had eaten three eggs that he hadn\u2019t paid for. This was left unresolved until he was minister in Ferslev. Then a bill came to him for three eggs, and it said that from the three eggs there could have come three chickens, and they could have laid so many eggs, and they continued like that figuring forward, until it was a bill so big that the minister couldn\u2019t pay it. Now he had no idea what he should do, and was in really bad straits since he\u2019d been summoned for it. Then one day the rogue says to him that he\u2019d meet up for him and he\u2019d set things in order. The minister thought this was great. The rogue travels off to Aalborg on the appointed day. He is supposed to appear at a certain time but he waits a half hour longer. When he finally goes in, they ask if he was the one who was to meet up for the minister. Yes, he was. Why did he wait so long? Yes, please excuse him, he had a barrel of boiled peas and he absolutely had to get them planted. \u201cWhat? Cooked peas can\u2019t grow,\u201d and they began reading up the case to him. \u201cPermission to ask a question,\u201d he says then, \u201cweren\u2019t the eggs boiled or fried or otherwise prepared?\u201d Yes, they were boiled. \u201cYou said that boiled peas couldn\u2019t grow, so how could you get chicks from boiled eggs?\u201d Yes, they had to admit that that couldn\u2019t happen. Well you\u2019re welcome to reach an agreement with the minister, said the rogue, because otherwise they\u2019d have him to deal with. So they had to give money to the minister instead of getting money from him. Then a while passed and he and the minister were great friends. But then they had a falling out. The rogue was the rogue and he made himself so deathly ill, and the minister was sent for to give him the last rites. Then the minister asks if he has something on his conscience and it would be for the best if he relieved his mind and told him. Yes he did, he had taken life from his first wife. Lord save us, that was a terrible sin. Had he done anything else? Yes, he had p... (pulet \u2013  screwed) seven dogs to death. You see the minister heard him out. \u201cYes, you are a horrible sinner, you must see about turning your life around, it is about time, if there is to be a conversion of such a sinner.\u201d Then he got better, the rogue did, he hadn\u2019t been sick at all. A little later he rides down to the minister with rye for his bread, but he got too close to a watering hole and his nag slips into it. The next year he was riding the same way on the same nag, and then he couldn\u2019t get near that hole. Then he said that his nag was wiser than the minister. The minister heard that, and he sued him for slander over that. When they were about to start the case, the rogue says that he\u2019s never hurt him or told any lies about him. \u201cWhat did you admit to me when you were sick?\u201d Yes, he hadn\u2019t done anything to be ashamed over. The minister continued to prod him and then he told him how things were. It was really bad weather and his wife was going to deliver, but they couldn\u2019t get a midwife, and so he did it himself. That was the life he\u2019d taken. That was that, but then the minister starts talking about the other crime he had committed. His dog had had seven puppies and they lay under the bed. Then one night he\u2019d been screwing his wife and the bottom of the bed fell out, and they had crushed all the puppies to death. That\u2019s what had happened. Then the minister had to start in on the complaint that his old nag was wiser than the minister. Yes, the rogue begins to explain that he was a fine upstanding person, and now he had to tell it as it was. The minister had seduced one of his hired girls and had gotten into serious difficulties to avoid being called father. But the next year he seduced the girl a second time. If the judge didn\u2019t think then that he\u2019d been right to say that the minister wasn\u2019t as wise as the nag when he\u2019d gotten into the ..... (presumably hole, although this is edited from the ms) a second time. The judge had to agree with him. Finally he said that what the minister had brought before the court were things that he otherwise wasn\u2019t allowed to make public, and now he requested that the judge remove him from his position as minister because of that. That happened too, so the rogue wasn\u2019t an easy one to deal with."}, {"story_id": 110, "full_name": "150 - 3.47 - JAT_VI_1129", "publication_info": "JAT_VI_1129", "annotation": "Jens continues with stories of the rogue from Mjels mentioned in the previous story (BJK 3.46), comparing him in part to Satan, who is also wont to give people rides in his carriage (BJK 3.02).

It follows directly on his stories and his own experiences of portentous dreams. In this variant, the wanderings of the mouse reveal the location of a buried treasure. Interestingly, and unlike many other stories of buried treasure, the farmhand who digs for the treasure is successful in his quest. Success in the treasure hunt may be related to earlier versions of this story that were known in Scandinavia (Chesnutt 1991).\n\n    The story is first attested in the writings of Paul the Deacon [Paulus Diaconus] from the eighth century. In his writings, he recounts the story of Guntram, the Frankish king of Burgundy and Orl\u00e9ans, (b.525-d.592). Variants of this story are accordingly referred to as the \"Guntram legend\" (Chesnutt 1991). In the Guntram legend, the king leaves his body as a snake, and his squire helps him cross a small stream by laying down his sword. The snake slithers into a hole and when the king awakens, he says he has dreamed of a magnificent treasure. When the hill is excavated, they discover a remarkable treasure--somewhat surprising given the snake's eye view that otherwise distorts the environment. Helinand of Froidmont (b.1160-d.1229) relates another variant of the story in his Chronicon (1211-1223), without the discovery of treasure. The animal in that story is a small white weasel-like creature.\n\n     Jens's variant maintains the motif of the companion's assistance in crossing the stream, and the discovery of the treasure. The soul takes the form of the tradition dominant mouse, and the treasure is sufficiently modest in keeping with the questions of perspective and scale attributed to the mouse (DS II G 102).\n\n     Christiansen notes that the story is widely attested, including a variant from Japan (Christiansen 1992, 47). In some Danish variants, the mouse returns and the farmhand is able to tell the news from home (DS II G 107), a phenomenon reminiscent of stories of Odin and his two ravens who keep him apprised of happenings in the world. In another variant, the farmhand's companion prevents the mouse from returning into the body of the sleeping farmhand, resulting in his death (DS II G 106).", "danish_manuscript": "To Karle i Heden at grav T\u00f8rv. 1 i S\u00f8vn\nhvid Mus ud af Halsen og hen til en Rende\nog l\u00f8b og sn\u00f8lrede.

On the one hand, there was great suspicion that many of the poor were free riders, getting something for nothing. On the other hand, there was a strong movement against the earlier, paternalistic poverty assistance programs that robbed the recipients of their dignity and their rights as citizens.\n\n     That the minister is selling grain to the poor seems a bit unusual, as one of the minister's duties was to distribute assistance to the poor. The administration of assistance to the poor was, for the first half of the century, a direct responsibility of the minister. Many communities chose to provide assistance in kind, handing out specified amounts of grain on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, rather than give cash. With the reforms to the laws governing local administration in 1867, the administration of these services was assumed by the local parish council.\n\n     The minister's sale of grain may fall outside official public assistance to the poor and may simply be part of his own attempts to make a living. All parsonage's had land attached to them, and the minister was expected to supplement his income with the produce from his land.

One of the strategies of combating a witch is to shoot her with a silver bullet, or something else made out of silver; buttons are commonly attested (DS VII 268). Ironically, the main character in the story, the man from T\u00f8rslev, is the local folk healer, and the witch's son is forced to ask him for the cure for his mother's ailment.

Her request for milk borders on begging which, according to the reforms to the poverty assistance laws in 1803, was strictly forbidden. On the other hand, poverty assistance, in the form of in kind almisse (alms), were an important part of the support for the poor, and many poor people did receive milk from farmers throughout the parish, either as part of an agreement with the parish poverty administration, or through private agreement (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 316). Karen's request for milk can be read as a symbolic representation of the ongoing request for support of the poor that many smallholders and farmers found to be a significant economic burden. The refusal to give St\u00f8v-Karen milk is explained in a later telling of this story: the husband will only eat milk-fed veal (JPP 4.14). The refusal is not based on the need to keep the farm functioning well, but rather to provide a luxury to the farm owner while the poor go hungry (or in this case, without milk).\n\n     St\u00f8v-Karen, whose nickname means \"Dust Karen,\" acts the part of a witch in this story. In other stories, she is referred to as a cunning woman (JPP 1.06) (R\u00f8rbye 1976; Tangherlini 2000). Her reaction to the initial refusal--bewitching the new calf so that it jumps about the barn--is extreme, and the death of the calf results in a far greater economic burden than her request for milk. Bewitching cows, or otherwise hurting the livestock, is a common antic of witches (DS VII 1179 and 1183). \n\n     The arrogance that Karen exhibits when she returns to the farm to collect milk is evident in the pitcher that she brings with her. While many poor might ask for a small pot of milk, Karen intends to walk off with an entire milk can, far more than a single person could hope to use before it would spoil, and reminiscent of the excessive supernatural milking described in other legends of witches (DS VII 591 and 592).\n\n     The farmer decides to confront the witch directly and beat her, as opposed to appealing to another intermediary such as a cunning person (DS VII 1180) or a minister (DS VII 574), strategies which tend to be effective, at least in narrative tradition (Tangherlini 1999). Not all ministers were willing to act as mediators (DS VII 176). The threat is not successfully mediated in this story and ultimately the farmer acquiesces to Karen's demands in an attempt to keep her witchcraft at bay. Her ability to change shape, in this case into a dark bird of prey, confirms that she is a witch.\n\n     After the rise of the collective dairies in the 1880s, many of the poor found that they no longer could count on getting milk from local farmers, as the dairies collected the milk each morning. In the seven short years following the establishment of the first cooperative dairy in 1882, six hundred additional cooperative dairies were established, primarily in Jutland. The result was that there was little or no excess milk production for the poor (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 316).\n\n     Tang Kristensen reversed the order of certain phrases in the story's orientation in the published version. He also added the tag that Jens Peter's mother was at the farm when the episode with the calf occurred, a tag that actually appears on page 6193a at the end of a story about some sheep that had disappeared (JPP 1.06).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand der hed Kristian Sten-\nbroen i Stenbroen i Taars, syd for\nBorup.

Skytte-Kr\u00e6n [Hunter Christian] is likely of much humbler origins than the merchant and innkeeper. He is quite possibly a cunning man, given both his nickname and the role he plays in this story (DS VII 144).\n\n    In related stories, manor lords are accused of having a pact with Satan (BJK 1.15; PJ 3.08).  There are also many stories in which the minister's wife's is revealed to be a witch (DS VII 149). In all these cases, the goal is to link the economically well-off or the politically powerful with the devil and, in so doing, undermine the legitimacy of their social and economic standing.\n\n     The accusation of witchcraft lost most legal power by the nineteenth century. By 1866 it was no longer possible to try someone in court for witchcraft (Johansen 1991, 25; Tangherlini 2000). The standard for proving an accusation of witchcraft was generally quite high, even during the seventeenth century when witchcraft trials were at a peak (Tangherlini 2000; Johansen 1991; Henningsen 1975). Changing shape from dog to human and back would likely have reached that standard. The black dog is a common shape for the devil and, given the close connection between the devil and witches, it is not hard to imagine a witch in dog form (Woods 1959; Valk 2001). Kristen Nielsen from Mosehuse, for example, also tells a variant in which the witch appears as a dog (DS VII 144). Otherwise, common animal shapes for the witch to assume are cats and hares (DS VII 141 and 145).\n\n     The power of naming as a form of control over the supernatural is a widely attested belief. Naming the witch is closely linked to other stories in which the witch's identity is brought to light (DS VII 149). In numerous other stories, naming the witch leads to the same type of transformation found in this story.

Ghosts in the cemetery need to be conjured back into the ground, as they threaten to disrupt the world of the living. In a Lutheran accommodation of folk belief surrounding ghosts, ghosts were linked to manifestations of Satan (Tangherlini 1998). There could hardly be a more threatening figure than Satan in a Lutheran community, and one of the most common strategies for dealing with him was to call for the minister (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n     Kathleen Stokker links this story to questions about the power of the minister, confession and salvation, focusing particularly on the \"Black Book minister\" of Norwegian tradition (Stokker 1992). She proposes that the minister is essentially powerless to stop the farmhand from sinking, and resorts to confession and extreme unction to at least guarantee the young man salvation. An alternate reading of these stories is less supportive of the minister: if he is powerful enough to conjure the young man, he should be powerful enough to unconjure him as it were. Instead, he continues with the conjuring--and effective burial--as a form of extreme punishment.\n\n      The resolution of this story is stark--the farmhand is dead and the minister's wife has gone mad.

In this story, the guilty haunt returns as a dog and wreaks havoc on the farm (Pentik\u00e4inen 1969). The desire to \"take it with you\" when you die comes across clearly here. \n\n     Eight hundred daler was a significant sum of money and would have represented a considerable estate for the wife and, presumably, her children. In most stories of ghosts that haunt for hidden money, the amounts are much more humble (DS V 1002). Usually, it is the owner who has hidden the money (DS V 1007), and he or she haunts to reveal its location. It makes little sense that the wife agrees to hide the money in the casket for her husband. Taking the money out of the household and local economy could hardly have been a good thing, and might account in part for the clear prohibition against hiding money in caskets. When he discovers the hidden money, the wise minister, Master Nielsen, insists on removing it, returning it to the wife and, by extension, the local economy. The discovery of the money prior to the man's burial, and his subsequent haunting because of that, distinguishes this story from other stories about haunts who return as solicitous haunts to reveal the location of money (DS V 972; Pentik\u00e4inen 1969). The haunt in this story is hardly solicitous, appearing to reclaim his fortune rather than give it away. The dog's rampage through the farm is nearly as destructive as the man's attempt to take the money with him.\n\n     The question also arises as to how the man had acquired this small fortune--the implication, given his return in the form of a destructive, black dog (read Satan) is that the money represents ill-gotten gains. Consequently, the haunt is not an innocent, solicitous haunt, but rather a guilty haunt; accordingly, it is far more dangerous to the community. \n\n     The minister confronts the haunt and forcibly conjures him down at a boundary zone, in this case the mill dam. Such conjuring, outside the bounds of the consecrated grounds of the church, is generally reserved for the devil and guilty haunts (DS IV 691).", "danish_manuscript": "En Mand der boede paa Aastrup M\u00f8lle\ns\u00f8nden og vesten for Hj\u00f8rring, h.

Here, the two farmers' amusing speculation about how different the rich really are leads the one farmer to put his money (or at least his horse and wagon) where his mouth is. Double entendres add significant humor to the story. The man's final evaluation of the countess as no different from anyone else is an endorsement of the liberal policies that had taken root in the peasant class--as well as among the urban elite--that people were equal, regardless of social class and wealth. It was this liberal thinking that ushered in an era of broad social and political change, from the democratic constitution of the mid nineteenth century to increasingly progressive social policies up through the early years of the twentieth century.\n\n     The leaseholds under Baggesvogn were sold at the beginning of the nineteenth century, although many of these sales included villeinage. Villeinage was seen unanimously by farmers and smallholders alike to be an undue burden. One of the main goals of the Venstre party in the period after the promulgation of the constitution was to pass legislation that would substitute cash payments for the in-kind work of villeinage.\n\n    Baggesvogn is five kilometers north of Sindal and was originally built in the fifteenth century. The main building was built in 1744. The dating of the legend is a bit off, as the Count Feer alluded to in the story was probably Peter Chr. de F\u00e6dder, who owned Baggesvogn from 1799-1803. He married Kirstine Gleerup (d. 1826), who was the daughter of the previous owner, Mourids Gleerup (d. 1820). From 1803-1812, Baggesvogn was owned by Georg  Moltke-Rosenkrantz, who in turn sold the estate to Michael Aagaard, who went bankrupt in 1820. In the more than five hundred years since it was first mentioned in the historical record, Baggesvogn has had 38 owners. ", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i 1806 der var en Grev Feer\npaa Baggesvogn.

Although Christiansen (1958) describes legends in which the devil is set to an innocuous task (for example making ropes of sand) while the person waits for assistance from a person more skilled in magic, there is no such salvation for the countess in this story.\n\n     One can read the countess's grisly death at the hands of the devil as a form of narrative retribution. In the previous legend, Jens Peter told of the poor treatment that the peasants received from the count, as well as the lax morals of the countess herself. In this story, the countess arrogantly attempts to undue the curse on the farm herself, rather than rely on the services of the Bragholdt hag for example, and her arrogance is punished decisively. \n\n      The punishment meted out by the devil is reminiscent of punishments suffered by those who have a pact with the devil (DS VI 144 and 150), and the countess's status as a wealthy landowner would make her equally suspect of this type of unholy alliance.\n\n     The countess transgresses numerous social norms during her s\u00e9ance. Bringing a draught animal into the house is unusual at best, and at worst proposes an inversion of the normal household organization. Enlisting the help of women of lower social status enacts two transgressions at once: First, it crosses the social boundaries that divide the classes and thus is reminiscent of her sexual dalliance with the farmer (JPP 2.05). Second, it exposes her hired hands to extraordinary danger, a reification of the mistreatment of workers for which she and her husband are known.\n\n     The black book, in Denmark referred to as Cyprianus, was often in the possession of both wise ministers and cunning folk. The name of the book is linked to Cyprian who was martyred in 290 (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 260). Here, the Bragholdt hag is a local cunning woman, even though Jens Peter describes her as a witch. Even though a Cyprianus would have been a prized possession, the countess would likely have had enough power to convince the Bragholdt hag to lend her the book.\n\n     Bragholt lies three kilometers slightly to the north and east of Baggesvogn. Later maps indicate two farms at Bragholt, \"Stor Bragholt\" and \"Lille Bragholt,\" probably a result of a division of the properties of the original Bragholt. It is unlikely that Bragholt was a manor farm; it was probably a large farm, perhaps a propriet\u00e6rg\u00e5rd. Again, the dating of the story seems unlikely, as the count at Baggesvogn in 1808 was Georg Moltke-Rosenkrantz, and not de F\u00e6dder. Of course, de F\u00e6dder's wife Kirstine did not die until 1826; she married Moltke-Rosenkrantz after her husband Chr. Peter de F\u00e6dder died, making Moltke-Rosenkrantz the count at Baggesvogn.", "danish_manuscript": "De havde\ns. mange stude paa Bagg. S. var det \nen Vinter de halve af dem d\u00f8de.

In this case, the Bragholdt hag gets her ability to show again from a small demon, a confirmation of her link to Satan. This link is implicit in her owning Cyprianus in the previous story (JPP 2.06). The Bragholdt hag's morality is drawn further into question when she is described as a drunk. One of the ongoing concerns in debates over the different classes of poor--the deserving and undeserving--was the high incidence of alcoholism among the poor, and the effects of alcoholism on their ability to provide for themselves.\n\n     Stories of questionable practices in the cunning woman's barn are fairly widely attested--enough for Tang Kristensen to include a subsection in his published collection Danske sagn entitled \"I den kloge kones lade om natten\" [In the cunning woman's barn at night] (DS VI, 323 and 326). In these stories, the cunning woman calls the devil to her to extract information (DS VI 898). The story, however, is not solely a criticism of the Bragholdt hag. The local economies of rural Denmark were moving quickly towards complete monetization by the last decades of the nineteenth century, and payment for services rather than barter arrangements had become the norm. In the story, Iver attempts to sidestep paying the Bragholdt hag for rendering a valuable service--canvas was important both as an item that could be sold and as a source of material for work clothes--only to discover that the implicit contractual arrangement held sway. She of course uses her supernatural power, rather than the power of the magistrate, to collect on her debt. But she also makes good on her side of the bargain, and the new economic order is firmly established: monetary payment for services rendered. In some variants, the person manages to get away without paying (DS VI 900), while others include a greater emphasis on the contractual arrangement than in this variant (DS VI 899).\n\n     That the canvas is hidden in the minister's meadow is a tantalizing variation on the story. In his repertoire, Jens Peter tells several stories of ministers who tread the fine line between good and evil. The implication in this story is that either (a) the minister--or perhaps his wife--had something to do with the theft or (b) someone is trying to frame the minister for the crime.     \n\n     Unlike Peder Johansen, who's father's foster father was a cunning man, and Ane Margrete Jensdatter (AMJ 2.20), whose stories generally endorse the powers of cunning folk, Jens Peter is critical of cunning folk. Here, he links the Bragholdt hag directly to the devil, and implies that she is in fact a witch. Her actions align her with another cunning person in his repertoire, St\u00f8v-Karen, who is interested primarily in personal gain (JPP 1.04). Jens Peter's critique of the cunning folk diverges from the critique proffered by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, who was much more of a rationalist and viewed the widespread belief in the ability of  witches and cunning folk to be foolish.\n\n     The distance from Knudsholm to Bragholdt is approximately fifteen kilometers.     \n", "danish_manuscript": "Der boede en Mand paa Knudsholmen\ni Ugilt Sogn, de kaldte ham Iver Hol\nmen eller den lange Iver, h. havde\net stort Stykke L\u00e6rred, der blev v\u00e6k\net Efteraar.

These capabilities certainly qualify the minister as a wise minister and align him with other wise ministers that figure prominently in Jens Peter's repertoire (JPP 1.07-09). Pastor Trap's apparent wealth and power is unusual for a local minister; Jens Peter connects this to Trap's alleged membership in the Freemasons. There are numerous stories about the Freemasons, describing them as having access to untold wealth (DS VI 48), but also indicating that they have a pact with the devil (DS VI 66).\n\n     The first Freemason organization in Denmark started in Copenhagen in 1743. This was modeled after the British Freemasonry that emerged in London in 1717. Danish Freemasonry was organized according to both German and British precedent through the first part of the nineteenth century. King Frederik VII was instrumental in changing the organization of the Danish lodge to the Swedish system of Freemasonry in 1858. Interestingly, Peder Johansen's boss at the mill in Fuldbro was a member of the masons (see biographical essay on Peder Johansen); despite this (or perhaps because of this), Peder did not tell any stories of the alleged supernatural abilities of masons.\n\n     Tang Kristensen collected other variants of this story that also included Pastor Trap's ability to foresee the date of his death (DS VI 68).

Not only does he threaten the economy of the community but also the physical well-being of everyone in it, including the children. \n\n    Numerous stories tell of the supernatural benefits of eating the hearts of children: extraordinary strength or the ability to make oneself invisible (DS IV 1588). The murder and ingestion of the most vulnerable members of the community for personal gain underscore the extraordinary threat represented by Daniel.\n\n    Punishment for murder was death, and execution by beheading was in force up until 1933.

In many variants, the girl does not realize that the man is dead until they arrive at the cemetery (DS II G 221). In Jens Peter's variant, the girl is terrified by the black dog digging in the cemetery, and she soon realizes that she is dealing with a horrifying revenant. It is somewhat surprising that she does not realize that she is dealing with a revenant already at the beginning of the story when her boyfriend rides up, since she should know that he is dead.\n\n     Jens Peter continues his story beyond the standard resolution in which the girl recognizes that her fianc\u00e9 is dead and runs for safety (DS II G 219). In his variant, the revenant appears at the door of the church house and attempts to enlist another dead person in capturing the girl. The girl's shredded apron on the grave stone is reminiscent of the shredded apron strings that reveal the true identity of a werewolf (BJK 2.15).\n\n     The rhyme that the boy recites is a common feature of the story, although the order of the first and second line is sometimes switched. The greatest variation is in the third line:  \"r\u00e6ddes du ikke lille Pige\" [aren't you getting scared, little girl] (DS II G 221); \"bliver du ikke bange min lille Pige\" [aren't you getting frightened my little girl] (DS II G 220); \"frygter du ej, mit hj\u00e6rte\" [do you not fear, my heart] (DS II G 220); \"er du ikke bange lille Lisbet\" [aren't you frightened, little Lisbet] (DSnr II G 136); \"er du bange mit Hj\u00e6rte\" [are you frightened, my heart] (DSnr II G 139); \"bliver du ikke bange, lille Pige\" [are you getting frightened, little girl] (DS II G 140); \"er du ikke bange, lille Pige\" [aren't you frightened, little giril] (DSnr II G 141); \"\u00c6 do et r\u00e6j, Karen?\" [Ain't you scared, Karen?] (DSnr II G 142); \"\u00e6 do et r\u00e6d, lille Maren\" [ain't you scared, little Maren] (DS II G 222 and DSnr II G 143); \"og kj\u00e6resten min s\u00f8rger ikke\" [and my sweetheart does not sorrow] (DSnr II G 145). Grundtvig in Gamle danske Minder  III (241-2) asked his readers to send him examples of the story in which the verse appeared, noting that, as of 1861, there were no Danish recordings of the legend.\n\n     Tang Kristensen added a long note to the end of the published version of this story, writing: \"Ved enligt liggende Kirker laa der tit et Kirkehus, hvor man s\u00f8gte til med smaa B\u00f8rn, der skulde d\u00f8bes o. lign. Af og til kunde der sidde et Fattiglem til Leje der. Ved Vindum Kirke har der f.

Every now and then a poor person could be there as a renter. At Vindum church, for example, in olden times there was a church house like that which has long since been torn down and nothing has been built in its place. The storyteller said that the coffin was turned, but isn't it more likely that it was the corpse in the coffin that was turned so it wound up lying on its stomach?] There is no reason to think that Jens Peter did not mean that the coffin should be turned, rather than the body. The general belief was that bodies should be carried out of the house feet first, otherwise they could return to the house to haunt. Apparently, the body has been left in the house with the head facing the door, making it possible for him to assist the boy's revenant in capturing the girl. Turning the coffin around would deny him that ability.", "danish_manuscript": "En Karl og en Pige havde svoret hinanden\nKj\u00e6rlighed i Liv og D\u00f8d. S. d\u00f8er Karlen\nog bliver begravet.

Then she sees a huge black dog that was clawing at the ground as hard as it could; it was digging at the grave where the boy had been buried. The girl had thrown her apron over the saddle because she thought it looked so pretty. When she saw the dog tossing dirt into the air she gets so scared that she runs away down to the church house. There was a man who lived in that house and a corpse had just been brought there which was supposed to have been buried the day before but had come too late. When the girl comes inside to this man, she tells him what has happened to her. Then the man says, \u201cLet\u2019s turn this coffin around.\u201d They turned the coffin that was standing there with the dead man in it around so that the head was pointing the other way. Soon thereafter there\u2019s a knock on the door and the name of the man who is lying in the coffin is called, he\u2019s supposed to open the door. But then the corpse answered that he was forbidden to do so, he\u2019d been turned and so he couldn\u2019t open the door. Now the girl stayed in the church house that night, but the next morning when the man went up to the cemetery to look for her apron he found it lying there, torn to pieces. She never saw the boy again.

In some stories, it is suggested that Odin's hunter hunts supernatural beings, particularly elves (DS II C 78). He is often accompanied by several dogs. \n\n     The name shows great variation across stories. In many stories, he is referred to as Wojens hunter. One variant suggests that he comes from the town of Wojens in Salling (DS II C 25). Other stories suggest that the hunter is King Valdemar (DS II C 36). \n\n     Many stories propose that the hunter has made an agreement with the Lord to be allowed to hunt for all eternity (DS II C 24). Feilberg provides an exhaustive list of attestations of Odins j\u00e6ger in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and German collections (Feilberg 2, 730-3). Lindow notes that the earliest attestation of this story comes from a Cistercian monk, Heliand de Froidmont, in a text preserved by Vincenz de Beauvais (Lindow 1978, 116).

In Kirsten Marie's story of a marriage between a Dane and a gypsy, the outcome is tragic (KMP 1.33). In this story, the marriage is more of an aside, and hardly a cause for approbation, worry or sorrow.\n\n     Although this story is reminiscent of Kirsten Marie's story of tricking a stodderkonge [beggar bailiff] (KMP 1.03), there are several important differences.  In that story, the stodderkonge is made to look foolish; here, the poorer farmhand simply takes advantage of an opportunity to get a little money from a person both drunk and known to be generous. The reversal of status--essentially begging from a natmand--is amusing, and does not seem to be worrisome to either Elias or Jens T\u00e5rs. \n\n     The apparent wealth of the gypsy aligns with the story of the gypsy birth banquet from Kirsten Marie's repertoire (KMP 2.07). In her story, the gypsies' wealth is a cause for suspicion and can be interpreted in the context of widely held conservative views of poverty assistance laws. Jens Peter seems to be more accepting, if not downright impressed, by Elias's wealth, and there is little implication that Elias is engaged in anything illicit. \n\n     Elias is criticized for being a snob,  something that is hard to imagine given the status of gypsies and natm\u00e6nd in rural Danish society. His desire for respect violates the unwritten rules of social decorum known as Janteloven [the Law of Jante] articulated by Aksel Sandemose in his popular novel, En flygtning krydser sit spor (1933). Elias's generosity makes up for his apparent desire to move up socially.  Unexpectedly, his wealth stems from his natmand work, as Jens Peter mentions in the story that Elias was on his way home to slaughter a horse. \n\n     Again, Jens Peter loads his narrative with local place names, and situates events and people in this narratively rich landscape. The mention of Natmandsbank [Nightman's Hill] reveals the degree to which the separation of this class of people permeated the local landscape. Interestingly, Jens Hansen moves out to this area once he marries into ELias's family. This would be akin to marrying down, since Jens Peter tells us that Jens Hansen was a farmer's son.

Jens Peter implicitly acknowledges this connection, as his next story is a variant of ML5080, \"Food from the Fairies\" (JPP 4.04). \n\n     The mound dwellers' baking is a model for low-level out group barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). The expectation of both parties is reasonable payment for services. In this story, the passing farmer enters into a contractual relationship with the mound dwellers, a relationship that he recognizes himself. The farmer, however, does not keep up his part of the bargain. One would expect that such a non-reciprocal transaction--effectively theft--would result in some form of retribution (or at least an attempt at retribution as in the case of the stolen drinking horn ML6045, \"Drinking Cup Stolen from the Fairies\"; JPP 4.04). Such is not the case here, and the man and his successors on the farm all get use of a remarkably well-forged tool, clearly of significant benefit to the farm's economy. The \"lang-j\u00e6rn\" [lit. long-iron] is known in English as a \"jointer knife\" and is a vertical blade that runs in front of the plowshare, and is used to help cut field stubble.\n\n     While it may be tempting to read the long iron as a gift from the mound dwellers (Boberg 1938; Mauss 1967), one would then have to disregard the statement, \"they didn't get any payment for it,\" a recognition that the encounter included an implicit, reciprocal, monetized transaction.\n\n     Tang Kristensen identified the supernatural beings in this story as dwarves, probably based on the Nordic mythological record that ascribes great prowess in smithing to dwarves. Jens Peter, however, makes no mention of dwarves, and it is more likely that the beings are the tradition dominant mound dwellers. This assignation would also link it to the next story about the mound dwellers' baking (JPP 4.04).\n\n     As typical for his stories, Jens Peter includes remarkable local detail about where the events transpired. L\u00f8rslev is just north of Ilbjerge huse, and Dals mill is just to the east.

The repair of the broken peel board is an example of a typical, low level, barter (non monetized) transaction with an out group trading partner. These stories allow narrators to explore--and endorse or reject--the advisability of such out group trade, as part of the growing rejection of the \"limited good\" model of economic organization (Tangherlini 1998; Foster 1965). \n\n     Out group trade can be a fraught proposition for a number of reasons. First, members of two different groups do not necessarily share the same values, and it can be difficult to calculate \"fairness\" in items traded, particularly in the realm of barter. Second, members from different groups do not necessarily have an expectation of repeated interaction. The rules governing one-off trade can be quite different from the rules governing continued trade. Stories of the mound dwellers baking explore many of these problems, and different narrators, through their choice of resolution, endorse widely divergent strategies for out group trade (Tangherlini 1998). In Jens Peter's version, the young hired boy refuses to take part in the transaction, and suffers dire consequences. The older farmer accepts the barter payment and thrives. \n\n     Tang Kristensen, as a note to the published version, wrote, \"J.P.P. viste mig H\u00f8jen, der virkelig nu er n\u00e6sten ukjendelig som H\u00f8j og kun viser sig som en lille Forh\u00f8jning i Jordsmonnet\" [J.P.P. showed me the mound which is now practically unrecognizable as a mound and appears as just a little rise in the ground].", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en der hed Svend, h. boede ogsaa \ni en Grd i L\u00f8rslev der nu er v\u00e6k.

The old sailor appears at first to be the voice of reason, refusing to join in with the rest of his shipmates. His solitary change of mind, however, puts him in a position of significant danger. Suicides absent themselves from community through the act of suicide itself and its aftermath. The self-centered pursuit of anything--wealth, fame or, in this case death--are generally decried narratively since all of these individual pursuits undermine community. The devil, of course, encourages the destruction of community. The Lutheran church considered suicide to be a sin, although Luther wrote: \"I don't have the opinion that suicides are certainly to be damned. My reason is that they do not wish to kill themselves but are overcome by the power of the devil\" (Luther 1967, vol. 54, 29). \n\n     In this story, the devil appears in the shape of a large, mysterious cat, one of his more common animal forms (Woods 1958). Interestingly, there is no appeal to religious symbolism in this story, which makes it unusual. In other stories of suicide, death is often averted by the use of such symbolism (JPP 4.06).\n\n     Suicide does not seem to be the goal of the sailors' bizarre undertaking. Rather, they seem interested in tempting death or, in this case, the devil. There is a small possibility that the men are engaged in a form of auto-erotic asphyxia as a way to pass the time, a suggestion that is hinted at in other stories (DS VI 431).\n\n      There are no statistics about suicide in the Danish navy from this period.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand nede i Jerup h. havde v\u00e6ret\ntil orlogs i den gl.

The man gets his comeuppance when he is forced to suffer his wife's labor pains. This story would have no doubt been quite attractive to women. \n\n     Midwives were more than specialized folk healers, although many midwives did in fact also practice as folk healers. They were part of a newly emerging class of civil servants and integral members of the emerging health care system (Norrie 1935; Petersen and Blomqvist 1996). The first midwife commission was established in Denmark in 1714. By 1791, all the districts in the country had a civil doctor (embedsl\u00e6ge) who could serve in the capacity of midwife, although that position was usually filled by a local, female midwife. In 1787, a national midwifery college opened in Copenhagen and, by 1810, a regulation was in place that required that all districts have a certified midwife. By 1851, every pastorate also had to establish a public health commission (sundhedskommission). All of these developments were part of an ever increasing process to improve people's health and reduce infant mortality.\n\n     Jens Peter's marriage was very short and produced no children. His wife may have died soon after they were married and, if that was the case, it is quite possible that she died in childbirth (much like Tang Kristensen's first wife); this might help explain why Jens Peter remembers this story.

It is worth noting that the chamberlain has the girl milk a cotter's cow to death, and not one of his own. \n\n     The girl is young enough not to be a full blown witch, and re-baptizing her proves efficacious against her budding relationship with Satan. Other stories describe young girls being initiated into witchcraft by older mentors (DS VII 527). These initiations always remove the young girls from the broader community. Re-baptism, conversely, allowed the neophyte witch to be accepted back into the community. In this story, the girl returns to her community as innocent as when she was born--and accordingly is transformed back into an infant. Jens Peter makes no mention of whether the girl later regained her faculties.\n\n     Jens Peter's coda provides an interesting insight into naming conventions in rural Denmark. Nicknames often referred to local places or houses. At the end of the century, it became more common for people to seek permission to change family names from patronymics to more individualized names, such as place names. In 1828, Frederik VI promulgated a baptismal order that required standardized and persistent family names (in favor of the earlier use of patronymics). By 1903, people who wanted to use place names as family names had to prove a clear relationship to that area.\n\n     B\u00f8rglum monastery was originally a royal landholding. Knud the Holy was driven from B\u00f8rglum when the Vendels rose up in 1086. In 1128, the holdings were given to the Cistercians, and B\u00f8rglum monastery became the See for the surrounding area. After the Reformation in 1536, B\u00f8rglum was reclaimed by the Crown and offered to various aristocrats as a len (fief). It was still used as the Bishopric until 1554, when Laurits Nilsson moved the Bishopric to \u00c5lborg. In 1623, B\u00f8rglum became part of Sor\u00f8 Academy, a school for young aristocrats. After the dissolution of the academy in 1669, it became an independent holding. The current Sor\u00f8 Academy is on Sj\u00e6lland, at another former Cistercian monastery. The reference to Chamberlain Hiller\u00f8d must be to Niels Friderichsen Hillerup (d. 1819), who acquired B\u00f8rglum in 1802 and also owned Vrejlev monastery.", "danish_manuscript": "[H. kunde] Kammerherre Hiller\u00f8d paa\nB\u00f8rglumkloster.

Many stories attest to the contractual arrangement between a nisse and his farmer, in which the farmer provides the nisse with one humble meal a year (porridge and butter), and possibly a new set of clothes (DS II B 146). In return, the nisse guarantees if not the wealth then at least the success of the farm in the coming year. The contract stands as an extreme version of the standard contract between farmhands and farmers. In this context, it is worth noting that the term \"nis\" is a diminutive for the name \"Niels,\" a common name for farmhands. The story also reflects the ambiguity related to negotiating contracts or engaging in transactions with members of an outside group.\n\n     In this story, the nisse believes the farmer has underpaid him for his work. Other stories consider what happens when the farmer overpays, usually by giving the nisse clothes that are too nice for his social status (farmhand) (DS II B 214).\n\n     The story of a nisse who kills the cow after not finding butter in his porridge is very common (DS II B 185). In some variants, the new cow tries to get back to its old farm or is otherwise confused about its new surroundings (DS II B 211). In some cases, the new cow is better than the one it replaced (DS II B 188). The stolen cow always comes from a neighboring parish, or even further afield. Theft outside of the community is apparently less problematic, perhaps because it does not impact the immediate economy. Crossing parish lines guarantees that the theft affects outsiders.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Gaardbo paa Stempegaard i\nB\u00f8rglum Sogn -- det er den ene af de to\nGaarde af det Navn og h. havde en r\u00f8d\nKo at passe og den skaff. h.

Liebrecht (1856) noted the similarity of this tale to Plutarch's story of Pan's death in De defectu oraculorum [On the disappearance of Oracles] (Boberg 1934, 7). Boberg, in her study of the Nordic variants of the story, proposed four main groupings: (1) Danish anthropomorphic supernatural beings (2) Danish cats (3) Swedish-Norwegian anthropomorphic supernatural beings and (4) Swedish-Norwegian cats (Boberg 1934, 14). Boberg observed that the death message generally results in an expression of sorrow in stories from groups 1 and 3, and an expression of joy in stories from groups 2 and 4 (Boberg 1934, 53). \n\n    Jens Peter draws an intriguing connection between the large tomcat who suddenly appears at the mill and mound dwellers. Although Boberg suggests that there are two distinct types of stories--one with mound dwellers, and one with cats--Jens Peter concatenates the two types here (Boberg 1934, 53). Interestingly, when a tomcat  appears in another of Jens Peter's stories, it is the devil in cat form (JPP 4.05).\n\n     The cat is clearly disruptive in the mill, killing both of the other cats. Cats are important at a mill since they keep the very destructive mice at bay. This cat, however, eats far more than its share of food and is a far greater menace than mice.  The joy that the cat / mound dweller expresses at the otherwise incomprehensible message is paralleled by the joy and relief of the people at the mill when the cat leaves.\n\n     Earlier interpretations of the legend have tried to connect the stories to ritual and cult practice, or to natural phenomena. Two nineteenth century German scholars, Wilhelm Mannhardt and G. A. Gerhard linked the story to the Sumerian-Babylonian god of fertility, Tam\u00fbz, an analog to the Greek god, Adonis, and fertility cults. In contrast, Taylor linked the stories to sounds such as the wind in the trees (Boberg 1934, 9-10; Taylor 1922).\n\n     None of these interpretations make much sense. Much of the narrative tension is related to the interaction between the supernatural being and the humans, and the humans are almost universally surprised to discover supernatural beings (or supernatural cats) living in their midst when they report the otherwise cryptic message. Once the death has been announced, the cat or supernatural being leaves, and the implicit thievery of the other world ends. Lindow proposes, in this connection, that a death among the supernatural beings is always a good thing for the human world (Lindow 2008).", "danish_manuscript": "For en 100 Aar siden var der kommen en\ngrum stor Hankat til Boller Vand-\nm\u00f8lle og h. slog alle de andre Katte\nihjel.

After a while, there\u2019s a shout: \u201cWe\u2019ve found them now.\u201d That\u2019s what it sounded like to the people, and immediately after there was an answer, \u201cCan I come too?\u201d The man shouts and says yes; but no sheep came, they didn\u2019t find them that night and they went about all night and looked for them and continued until dawn. Finally they found them. There was continual haunting on the farm and in the house, so much that the people could barely stay there. Right nearby there was a big pond, and in the afternoon in broad daylight, wheels and half wagons and other things could appear in the pond, and no one could understand what was going on. There was also frequently a ruckus in the house. They sought out cunning people and even ministers--Jerslev minister was there several times--and after a while they managed to quiet it; but it was really there for many years. Sometimes fifty or so people could stand and watch as something rose up out in the pond. When it disappeared it made strange noises. None of the occupants wanted to stay at the farm and it was finally sold for next to nothing."}, {"story_id": 186, "full_name": "241 - 4.14 - DS_VII_491a", "publication_info": "DS_VII_491a", "annotation": "St\u00f8v-Karen is an ambiguous figure in Jens Peter's stories. On the one hand, she acts like a witch, threatening the farm and causing the death of the calf. The farmer's selfishness, however, may justify this response. In the other stories, St\u00f8v-Karen acts more like a cunning woman, and is far more willing to help restore or protect both the physical and economic well-being of the local farmers. This ambiguity may well reflect the liminal space occupied by the cunning folk: they were at once revered for their ability to heal people and find lost and stolen things, and at the same time feared for their apparent supernatural abilities that, implicitly or explicitly, linked them to Satan (Tangherlini 2000). St\u00f8v-Karen's inability to say \"Christ\" further links her to witches.\n\n     In an earlier meeting with Tang Kristensen, Jens Peter told a variant of these stories (JPP 1.04 and 1.06); the intervening story of the sick farmer's wife is a new addition.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Kone der boede der nede vesten \nfor Vugdrup i Taars Sogn i et Hus de\nkalder St\u00f8vhuset og hende kaldte de St\u00f8v-\nKaren.

The woman [of the house] says to her, \"No, I can't today, because we have a calf and my husband won't eat veal unless it has been milk-fed. But in eight days we'll slaughter it and then you can come and get milk.\" Then the woman went away, but she had barely left before the calf got sick and began to jump up and down the walls and continued to jump until it had killed itself. It's no lie because my mother was there and grew up there. Then the man [of the house] gets mad and he goes off down to St\u00f8vhuset the next morning and took a large staff in his hand. He meets her a little to the west where the poorhouse is now, and she came walking along with a pail in her hand. Before he got to her, she plants her staff in the ground and she turned herself into a crow and stood on the top of the staff and crowed.

Well, so then she comes soon after and the wife says to her: \"Yeah, you better believe that we've suffered a big loss because of you.\" She answered: \"Well Chri ... I can't do anything,\" (she couldn't say Christ properly). Well the calf had become crazy and had killed itself. Well, she was totally innocent of that. The wife gave her a lot of meat and bread and a bit of everything because they'd gotten scared of the haunting. She kept living at St\u00f8vhuset for a long time. The woman in Vester Vugdrup got so sick and she lay in bed for a long time and she couldn't eat any of their own food. She could eat a little bit of other people's food (foreign food). It lasted for about half a year and she got so bad and couldn't do anything. Then they had a shepherd who took care of the sheep and he went down to St\u00f8vkaren every day. Then she taught him her arts (and I know this because I've talked to him and he had to admit it to me). Then the woman in Vester Vugdrup got this boy to go down to St\u00f8vkaren one day and ask her advice, if she could give her some advice, she could only eat foreign food and only a little bit of that. This boy was in good with this hag. He probably got some money for doing it well. Then the hag says to him, since it is you my little boy who comes and asks so nicely for his madmoder [foster mother], I'll help her. I've baked today and here is a new loaf of bread, it's warm, bring it home and give it to her. But tell her that she shouldn't eat too much, because she won't be able to handle it, she'll start eating now. Then she almost ate the whole thing at one sitting. It was at harvest time and the woman got better immediately after and became healthy. Then in the fall, their sheep disappeared down there in Vester Vugdrup, they were gone for five days, and they rode all over Taars parish and looked for them over by the church, but they couldn't find them. Then they have this little boy go down to her again and ask her if she knew where the sheep were. Sure, she could easily tell him that. Yes, they were standing out by a river in the area south of B\u00e6stholm in Vrejlev, and they were completely surrounded by water on a little island and had been standing there for 5 days. But now I'll go and call to them. Then she took a bell in her hand and went out and started ringing it. Now you can go home and say that I've called them, they'll come back now.

The Cyprianus, a book of magic spells and incantations, was considered to be a source of power in and of itself (Davies 2009, 123-132). It was closely related to the devil, and both witches and cunning folk, as well as wise ministers, were said to have possessed the book. Many cunning folk based their practice on ownership of the book alone (R\u00f8rbye 1976).  In many stories, the book is used expertly to conjure ghosts, while in other stories, less than expert use of the book results in misfortune from the insignificant, as in this brief account, to utter calamity (JPP 2.06 and 4.20). \n\n     Narratively, Jens Peter brings the Cyprianus into his immediate sphere, indicating his own willingness to possess the book. In many stories, the Cyprianus is difficult to get rid of: it cannot be burned (DS VI 216), and it reappears even if one has tried to get rid of it (DS VI 222).\n\n     Tang Kristensen collected copies of the Cyprianus, acquiring them whenever he had the chance. In Minder og Oplevelser, he writes about one of his copies of the book that was in a museum display in Copenhagen: \"men betingede mig, at den skulde l\u00e6gges saadan, at Folk ikke kunde komme til at blade i den eller overhovedet r\u00f8re ved den.

He went along with that, and a glass case was made for it, in which it lay opened to the page where the word Cyprianus was printed in red letters] (MO III 174).

There are numerous legends that explain the absence of wolves in Denmark, attributing it to the actions of a witch who bargains for her head (DS VII 690). The unusual greeting occurs in other variants of this story, and is explained that, had the witch's interlocutor called the animals by name (wolves), they would have torn him apart (DS VII 696 and 700).\n\n     In the late seventeenth century, witches were dealt with harshly. The Danish Law of 1683 includes the following stipulation for their punishment: \"Befindis nogen Troldmand, eller Troldqvinde, at have forsoret Gud og sin hellige Daab og Christendom, og hengivet sig til Dievelen, den b\u00f8r levendis at kastis paa Ilden og opbr\u00e6ndis\" [If any troll-man or troll-woman (witch) has been found to have rejected God and his or her Holy Baptism, and given him or herself to the Devil, then they should be thrown alive onto the fire and be burned up] (Bk 6, Ch 1, Par 9).

The acquisition of great wealth without the proper input of work, such as occurs with successful treasure hunts or gambling, is related in these stories to antisocial behavior. The \"absenting\" from community implicit in the prohibition against speaking during the treasure hunt is a precondition for attaining great riches (from a clearly demonic creature). But the successful treasure hunt comes with a considerable downside: the destruction of the community, often represented by visions of the church or village burning. In this story, as in many of these stories, one of the treasure hunters breaks the taboo by speaking and the treasure sinks out of reach. But the community ties are reaffirmed. To emphasize the reestablishment of community, the handle of the chest is enshrined in the local church, a parallel to the use of the mound dweller's drinking horn to build a new church (KMP 1.61). \n\n     The verse the dragon quotes in this story is attested in several variant forms in Tang Kristensen's collection (DS III 2316; See also DS III 2318, 2320, and 2321). One of these variants was told by Gerhard Peter (G.P.) Andersen, who is mentioned in relation to one of Jens' stories about merfolk (DS III 2316; JPP 4.02). In some variants, witnesses see the dragon relocating, along with the treasure, from the mound to the lake. The buried treasure in the lake offers a clear parallel to stories of church bells in lakes (PJ 3.14; DS III 527, 529, 531, 533, 535). They too are often difficult to get up, but in those stories, the community's godlessness is often at the root of their inability to reacquire this clear symbol of community.\n\n     The motif of a dragon guarding a treasure is best known from the V\u00f6lsunga saga, where Fafnir, transformed from man into dragon, jealously guards his horde, only to be slain by Sigurd.", "danish_manuscript": "Der gik Sagn af at der skulde v\u00e6re s. mange\nPenge i Stovh\u00f8j--den st\u00f8rste Top af\nIlbj\u00e6rge.

The two men, out late at night, are interested in getting home quickly, and so they borrow a convenient horse. Unfortunately, in a widely attested motif, the horse is actually the devil. Not surprisingly, hitching a ride on the devil's back turns dangerous, with riders either carried high into the sky (DS II D 109), or tossed into rivers or lakes (DS II D 99). In the latter case, it is usually young girls on their way home at night from a knitting room who climb the horse to ford a stream (DS II D 73). \n\n     In almost all cases, the horse is taken without permission. Generally, the horse is easy to catch, tempting the rider(s) to steal it. The resolution often mentions that the rider changes his or her behavior, suffers physically from the ride, or is marked for life from the encounter.\n\n     Riding the easily caught horse with disastrous consequences is reminiscent of Einar's ill-advised riding of Freyfaxi in Hrafnkels saga (J\u00f3n 1950). In that saga, Einar rides a horse that he has been expressly forbidden from riding and, as a result, he is executed. The punishment for stealing horses in nineteenth century Denmark was less extreme, although the Danish Law defined the theft of a farmer's horse as h\u00e6rv\u00e6rk (vandalism); the perpetrator would be fined and forced to pay compensation. \n\n     There is some confusion over the Captain's name. At the beginning of the recording (JPP 4.21), Tang Kristensen writes the name as Skj\u00e6rul, but later in the manuscript, he uses the spelling Skj\u00e6rulf. Although there is no division between this story and the preceding in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen splits the stories in his published versions and, because of this split, he adds some things, such as the reference to Linderumg\u00e5rd in the first line, and deletes other things, such as the narrative connector, \"Right after that...\"", "danish_manuscript": "Knap efter kom dh.

But the coachman didn't think so and it ended up that he fell in love with another girl and was going to get married to her.

The boy thought that these were some nice hats and so he shouts, \"Let me have one too.\" All the hats disappeared, all except one, and the boy got that one. Well, he put it on, and he gets up and goes home and was going to have his lunch. He comes in and sits down at the table and keeps the hat on. Then he could see that there sat all these little guys with hats on in between all the people and ate just as fast as they could. None of the people could see them because they had their hats on. Well, he gets up again and nobody had seen him either because he had a hat on. Then he comes home driving the sheep that evening, they didn't know he'd been home. Then the people say to him, \"Why didn't you come home and have your lunch today?\" He was a real rough guy and he swore up and down he'd been there. Well they didn't believe him because they hadn't seen him. \"Yes, there were also a lot more people at the table, it was a group of little people up from the mound. You couldn't see them because they had hats on, but I could see them. They swore that was a lie. \"Yeah, I also had a hat on and that's why you didn't see me either.\" Then the minister found out and the boy said to him: They could either borrow the hat or the minister could see it.

Naa, han tog den paa, og han rejser ogsaa hjem og skal have hans Onden. Han kommer ind og s\u00e6tter sig ved Bordet og beholder Hatten paa. Da kunde han se, der sad saa mange smaa Fyre med Hattene paa imellem Folkene og spiste lige saa st\u00e6rkt, som de kunde. Der var ikke nogen af Folkene, der kunde se dem, for det de havde deres Hatte paa. Naa, han rejser af igjen, og ingen havde heller set ham. Saa kommer han og driver hjem med Faarene om Aftenen, og saa siger Folkene til ham: \"Hvorfor kom du ikke hjem og fik din Onden?\" Det var en grumme vigtig Kn\u00e6gt, og han bandte saa, han havde v\u00e6ret der.

Saa vilde han laane den. Da han fik Hatten paa, kunde Folkene paa Gaarden heller ikke se ham. Saa t\u00e6nkte Pr\u00e6sten: der maatte lige godt v\u00e6re noget ved den Hat, og han m\u00f8der da selv ved Spisningen n\u00e6ste Middag. Da var de m\u00f8dt igjen der oppe fra H\u00f8jen, og han saa, hvordan de spiste meget mere end hans Folk. Saa kunde han forstaa, hvorfor Maden ikke kunde forslaa, og da Pr\u00e6sten var en klog Mand, saa dannede han det saadan, at de kunde ikke komme der mere at spise.

This was at least a hundred years ago. There were two or three large mounds on the parsonage\u2019s field, and they believed that there were probably mound dwellers in them, but they didn\u2019t know for sure. The minister had a lot of sheep that would graze and he had a shepherd who would guard them. The shepherd was lying up there on the mounds at lunch time one day, and then they ring to lunch down at the parsonage. Then they shout down inside the mound, since it turned out it was that mound that the mound dwellers were in, \u201cNow they\u2019re ringing down in the parsonage, now we need to get our hats out.\u201d Then all these little hats come out of a little hole in the mound. The boy thought that these were some nice hats and so he shouts, \u201cLet me have one too.\u201d All the hats disappeared, all except one, and the boy got that one. Well, he put it on, and he gets up and goes home and was going to have his meal. He comes in and sits down at the table and keeps the hat on. Then he could see that all these little guys with hats on were sitting there in between all the people and ate just as fast as they could. None of the people could see them because they had their hats on. Well, he gets up again and nobody had seen him either. Then he comes home driving the sheep that evening, and the people say to him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come home and have your lunch today?\u201d He was a real rough guy and he swore up and down he\u2019d been there. Well they didn\u2019t believe him because they hadn\u2019t seen him. \u201cYes, there were also a lot more people at the table,\u201d he said, \u201cit was a group of little people up from the mound. You couldn\u2019t see them because they had their hats on, and that's why you didn\u2019t see me either.\u201d Then the minister found out and the boy said to him: He could either see the hat or he could borrow it. So he wanted to borrow it. When the minister put the hat on, the people at the farm couldn\u2019t see him either. Then the minister thought: there\u2019s probably something about this hat. And so he shows up to lunch the next day. The ones from the mound had come as well and he saw how they ate much more than his people. Then he understood how the food was never enough, and since the minister was a wise man, he made it so that they couldn\u2019t come and eat there any longer. Then the mound dwellers left the district because, since they didn\u2019t get any food, they couldn\u2019t stay there, and they didn\u2019t notice them anymore."}, {"story_id": 215, "full_name": "241 - 4.43 - DSnr_I_404", "publication_info": "DSnr_I_404", "annotation": "Stories of a farmer inadvertently damaging the roof of a mound dweller's house are common (DS I 593).

While some have argued that the \"Norwegian\" in theseis actually a S\u00e1mi, there is little evidence in any of these stories that support this surmise. Instead, it is likely that this explanation obtains in Sweden and Norway in reference to Finns, where farmers would have been in contact with S\u00e1mi, but not in Denmark, where meeting a S\u00e1mi would have been a truly unusual event.\n\n     The curse undermines the already shaky economy of the farm, an economy made all the shakier by the burden of the farmer's villeinage at \u00c5strup (the farm is presumably a leasehold under the estate at \u00c5strup). The farmer's generosity to the wandering Norwegian leads to a reciprocal relationship, similar to the one between the farmer and the mound dweller found in the preceding story (JPP 4.43). The curse on the farm is a fairly typical witch's curse, and is intended to destroy the farm's economy. The form of the curse relies predominantly on contagious magic, with the bones and skin of the animals used to control and kill the farm animals. Not surprisingly, the witch turns out to be a neighbor, and the neighbor witch begging to be let in is a widely attested motif (DS VII 1357).\n\n     As in many of his stories, Jens Peter vouches for the veracity of the story by emphasizing his personal connection to someone in the story, or someone who knew someone in the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en M. i N\u00f8rre Harridslev\nh gjorde Hoveri til Aastrup ve-\nsten Hj\u00f8rring og h. mist da saadan\nen Masse H\u00f8veder baade Heste og\nK\u00f8er og Faar og Svin og Gj\u00e6s og \u00c6nder\nog H\u00f8ns, kort sagt alt hvad h.\n\n7824A\nhavde og h. var s. rasende fattig.

He had four horses, but two of them were so thin and weak that they couldn't do anything. They hung in some ropes and were near death. The man was supposed to go to L\u00f8kken with a load of grain for the manor lord and had to have these two horses harnessed up. At the time an old Norwegian had come here to the country, he was cunning and could cure such things. He was supposed to have helped many others. Then there were some who'd told him about this farmer and how bad off he was. He goes over there and comes on the evening that the man was out driving to L\u00f8kken and wanted to talk to him about that. But the man wasn't home then. Then he asks the farmer's wife if he can't stay there that night. No, she says no, that couldn't be done. They were poor people and couldn't afford to have strangers lodging with them and she was harsh and chewed him out. But he just kept sitting there since people had told him to stay until the man came home. Later that night the man comes back from L\u00f8kken and he gave the Norwegian permission to stay there, it was too late to leave now. He had a bottle of akvavit along home from L\u00f8kken and they sat there and emptied it that night and were feeling good. Then this here old Norwegian became a little more talkative. Then he says, \"How is it that you lose so many cattle and horses?\" Well, he couldn't stay at the farm, he says, he was about ready to leave it any day now, because he lost everything, and it was probably evil people who were at fault. Well, then the Norwegian starts to talk and says, \"There's a remedy for that.\"--No, says the man, he'd given a lot of money to have it cured and there'd been a lot of cunning folk. \"Well, let me stay here tonight,\" says the Norwegian, \"then we can take a look at it tomorrow morning.\" He stayed there and the next morning, they got up and he says to the wife, \"Take an entire basket of peat and make a fire in the fireplace.\" Yes, she'd do that. \"Well, then we'll go out to the barn and see if we can't figure out a remedy for this.\" The Norwegian went back and forth in there and then he pointed at a large stone that was lying there in the stone floor and they were to pull it up. No there wasn't anything under it, they could put it back down. Then he went back and forth a couple of times, and then he says, \"It should be here,\" there was also a big stone in there. They got a metal bar and lifted the stone. Underneath it there was a hole big enough to fit a couple measures. There were also all sorts of bones, both horses and cows and pigs and the like, and there was hair from them too, and there were bones and feathers of chickens and and the like and tied onto these hairs were so many bad luck knots that the cunning man filled a two bushel basket when he'd gathered it all together and carried it out. Then the Norwegian calculated by looking at all that that it could have lasted for another hundred years that they'd lose animals at that farm before it would have ended. They carried it into the kitchen. Then they had to shut all the doors and windows tightly and plug all the holes in the main room, because now they were going to throw everything that was in the basket onto the fire, and the evil-doer would come immediately. It wasn't too long after all those things and the bones were on the fire before their neighbor's wife came and really wanted to come in, and she yelled and screamed, she really needed to talk to them. But she wasn't allowed to because the Norwegian was afraid that it wouldn't help if she came in, and so she wasn't allowed in. After that filth had been burned to ashes, they carried it out to the dunghill and they never lost a thing again and he became a clever man and his grandchildren have the farm to this very day.

S\u00e5 hen p\u00e5 aftenen kommer manden fra L\u00f8kken, og han gav Nordmanden lov til at blive der, det var jo for sent at g\u00e5 nu. Nu havde han en flaske br\u00e6ndevin med hjem fra L\u00f8kken, og den sad de og t\u00f6mte om aftenen og blev s\u00e5dan godt tilpas, og denher gamle Nordmand blev noget mere snakvis. S\u00e5 siger han: \"Hvordant er det med dig, du mister jo s\u00e5 mange h\u00f6veder og hester?\" Ja, han kunde ikke blive ved g\u00e5rden nu, siger han, han var f\u00e6rdig til at g\u00e5 fra den, hvad dag det skulde v\u00e6re, for han mist' jo al ting, og det var nok onde folk, der var skyld i det. Ja, s\u00e5 tager Nordmanden ordet og siger: \"Det kunde der vel og r\u00e5des bod p\u00e5.\" \u2014 Nej, siger manden, han havde givet mange penge ud for at f\u00e5 det kureret og v\u00e6ret ved mange kloge m\u00e6nd, men det hjalp jo lige meget. \"Ja, nu bliver a jo her i nat\", siger Nordmanden, \"s\u00e5 kan vi se p\u00e5 det i morgen tidlig.\" Om morgenen, de kom op, siger han til konen: \"Nu skal du tage en hel kurvfuld torv og gj\u00f8re ild p\u00e5 arnestedet.\" Ja, det skulde hun nok. \"S\u00e5 vil vi g\u00e5 ud i n\u00f8dset og se, om vi kan ikke finde \u00e9n ting r\u00e5d for dether.\" Nordmanden han gik frem og tilbage der inde, og s\u00e5 viste han p\u00e5 en stor sten, der l\u00e5 inde i pikningen. Den skulde br\u00e6kkes op. Det skete, nej, der var ingen ting under den, den kunde de l\u00e6gge ned igjen. S\u00e5 gik han frem og tilbage igjen et par gange, og s\u00e5 siger han: \"Her skal det v\u00e6re.\" Det var ogs\u00e5 en sten, der l\u00e5 der inde, som han nu pegte p\u00e5. De havde en st\u00e5lstang og l\u00f8ftede stenen, og der under var et hul s\u00e5 stort, at det kunde tage godt et par skj\u00e6pper. Der var ogs\u00e5 alle slags ben b\u00e5de af heste og k\u00f8er og f\u00e5r og svin o. s. v., og der var h\u00e5r af dem, og der var ben og fjer af h\u00f6ns og \u00e6nder og gj\u00e6s. P\u00e5 de h\u00e5r var der knyttet s\u00e5 mange ulykkes-knuder, at den kloge mand fik en toskj\u00e6ppe-kurv helt fuld, da de fik det hele samlet sammen og fik det b\u00e5ret ud. Han regner ud ved at se alt det, at det kunde have varet et helt hundrede \u00e5r, inden det fik ende, s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge skulde de alts\u00e5 have haft mist p\u00e5 deres kreaturer. De bar det nu ind i kj\u00f8kkenet, og s\u00e5 skulde de lukke b\u00e5de d\u00f6re og vinduer t\u00e6t og stoppe alle huller p\u00e5 rollingen, for nu kom alt det p\u00e5 ilden, der var i kurven, og s\u00e5 skulde deres skademand nok komme lige straks. Det varede heller ikke svar l\u00e6nge, inden deres nabokone kom og vilde endelig have v\u00e6ret ind, og hun r\u00e5bte og skreg, hun skulde endelig snakke med dem.

He lost a huge number of animals, both horses and cows and sheep and pigs and geese and ducks and chickens, in short, everything that he had, and there had to be evil people at play. Now he had four horses, but two of them were so thin and weak that they couldn\u2019t do anything, they hung in some ropes and were near death. Then the man was supposed to go to L\u00f8kken with a load of grain for the manor lord and had to have these two horses harnessed up. At the same time, an old Norwegian had come here to the country, he was one who was cunning and could cure such things, and he\u2019d helped many others. Then there were some who\u2019d told him about this farmer and how bad off he was. He goes over there and comes the very evening that the man was supposed to drive to L\u00f8kken and wanted to talk to him about that. But since the man wasn\u2019t home, he asks the farmer\u2019s wife if he can\u2019t stay there that night. No, she says no, that couldn\u2019t be done; they were poor people and couldn\u2019t afford to have strangers lodging with them. See, she was harsh and chewed him out; but he just kept sitting there, and people told him to stay until the man came home if he wasn\u2019t there at the moment. Then later that night the man comes back from L\u00f8kken and he gave the Norwegian permission to stay there, it was too late to leave now. Now he had a bottle of akvavit along from L\u00f8kken and they sat there and emptied it that night and they were feeling good and this here old Norwegian became a little more talkative. Then he says, \u201cHow is it that you lose so many cattle and horses?\u201d Well, he couldn\u2019t stay at the farm, he says, he was about ready to leave it any day now, because he lost everything, and it was probably evil people who were at fault. Well, then the Norwegian starts to talk and says, \u201cThere\u2019s a remedy for that.\u201d--No, says the man, he\u2019d given a lot of money to have it cured and there\u2019d been a lot of cunning folk, but it didn\u2019t help any. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll stay here tonight,\u201d says the Norwegian, \u201cthen we can take a look at it tomorrow morning.\u201d The next morning, they got up and he says to the wife, \u201cTake an entire basket of peat and make a fire in the fireplace.\u201d She agreed to do that. \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll go out to the barn and see if we can\u2019t figure out a remedy for this.\u201d The Norwegian went back and forth in there and then he pointed at a large stone that was lying in the stone floor. They were to pull it up. They did that and no there wasn\u2019t anything under it, they could put it back down. Then he went back and forth a couple of times, and then he says, \u201cIt should be here.\u201d There was also a stone in there which he now pointed at. They got a metal bar and lifted the stone, and underneath it there was a hole big enough to fit a couple bushels. There were also all sorts of bones, both horses and cows and pigs and the like, and there was hair from them too, and there were bones and feathers of chickens and ducks and geese. Tied onto these hairs were so many bad luck knots that the cunning man filled a two bushel basket when he\u2019d gathered it all together and carried it out. He calculated that it could have lasted for another hundred years before it would have ended, that\u2019s how long they would have lost animals there. They carried it into the kitchen and then they had to shut all the doors and windows tightly and plug all the holes in the main room, because now everything that was in the basket was thrown onto the fire, and the evil-doer would come immediately. It wasn\u2019t too long either before their neighbor\u2019s wife came and really wanted to come in, and she yelled and screamed, she really needed to talk to them. But she wasn\u2019t allowed to because the Norwegian was afraid that it wouldn\u2019t help if she came in, and so she wasn\u2019t allowed in. After that filth had been burned to ashes, they carried it and the bone stumps out to the dunghill and after that they never lost a thing.

This association builds on a folk etymology that proposes a common stem for the word for elves, \"ellefolk\", and the word for alder wood, \"elletr\u00e6\" (AMJ 2.15 and KMP 1.60). Elves' backs are frequently described as looking like rotted tree trunks, an image that at once causes the human to recoil in disgust and reaffirms the close connection between these beings and nature, particularly forests (DS II A 59). The dance of the elf women that Kirsten Marie describes is similar to the dance of the mound dwellers who also attempt to seduce or kidnap humans into their community (PJ 2.11).\n\n     The food that the elf woman offers the man is reminiscent of legends about the mound dwellers' baking (Boberg 1938). In those legends, however, the food offered is part of a well-structured barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). In this case, the food is offered more as a gift; since the man has no history of interaction with this out group member, he is rightfully suspicious of the implications of the gift, particularly since elves are also seductresses (Mauss 1967).\n\n      The forest ranger's reaction--to cut a cross in the cake with his knife--is a common strategy to counter the potentially threatening supernatural gift. Here the threat is threefold, manifest in the pancake and the elf woman herself. The food may well be poisonous (as the food of the other world often is) and thus it could threaten the man's physical well-being. The woman may not only be attempting to disrupt the forest ranger's economic activity by distracting him with sex, but also may be trying to derail the normal ability of a community to perpetuate itself. The ranger's action serves at once as an expression of man's control over nature, in the form of the knife made out of worked metal, and the expression of the religious (Christian) nature of the human community, in the form of the cross he cuts in the cake. The efficacy of his action is clear, as it eliminates both the threat of the food and the threat of the woman.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Skovfoged i Nielstrup var over\nHval\u00f8se Vii.

Instead, it relies on several key concepts in Danish folklore for its reportability. The concept of the outsider is addressed in the unusual gate that the manor lord and lady are forced to drive through, associating the island of Funen in a peculiar way with the conceptual category \"outside,\" as the whale bone gates and the seemingly windowless house indicate otherness. Class differences are apparent on two levels: the story is reported not by the manor lord or lady, but rather by their servant, the coachman. His attitude toward the mistress in particular may be read in the reported direct speech of the mistress on seeing the condition of the house. She is pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the farmer's wife, a form of narrative criticism in that the upper class discovers that the lower farming class (to which Kirsten Marie belonged) was perhaps not as \"below\" the aristocracy as they would have it. The privy councilor and the lady are also brought down a social notch in the short exchange between them. Not surprisingly, it is the coachman who makes sure that they are well-quartered for the night. The lady's expression--Bong wahrhaftig--is not commented on by Tang Kristensen nor is it glossed by Feilberg.

Kirsten Marie frequently recounts the adventures of her father in her storytelling. In this case, her father plays a good-natured trick on the beggar bailiff, the man charged by the local authorities with keeping beggars from outside the parish away. The beggar bailiff was generally chosen from local people receiving poverty assistance. This primitive form of control over the movement of itinerant beggars was intended to keep the burden of poverty assistance at a reasonable level throughout the parish.\n\n      Kirsten Marie's obvious delight in her father's antics that indirectly challenge the local governing board, while directly teasing the low status beggar bailiff, reveal her attitudes to a relatively complex series of status divisions functional in late nineteenth century rural Denmark. Kirsten Marie's father is, at the time of the events, a hired hand, and only incrementally better off than the beggar bailiff. His masquerade as a beggar enacts this tenuous divide. By contrast, when Kirsten Marie tells the story, she sees herself as a farm owner's wife, and thus narratively parallel to the farmer's wife who provides alms for the false beggar and the beggar bailiff. The farmwife in the story is narratively powerful, aware of the identity of the false beggar and firm in her protection of him from the otherwise justified actions of the beggar bailiff, Rasmus.\n\n     The story enacts an amusing twist with Kirsten Marie narratively allowing her (and her brother Rasmus's) father to toy with an officer of the poverty assistance board, thereby questioning the efficacy of that office. In this context, it is worth noting that Kirsten Marie's brother, Rasmus Kj\u00e6r, was an important figure in local politics at the time she told the story.\n\n     The second part of the story where Kirsten Marie's father steals the beggar bailiff's food is reminiscent of a well known contemporary legend in which a person mistakenly eats someone else's food, often on board a train or at a cafeteria (Klintberg 1986; Zola Christensen and Christensen 2001). Those stories, referred to in Danish under the rubric of \"Snylteren,\" rely on a twist: the main character believes a person is openly and aggressively stealing his or her food but subsequently discovers that the apparent thief was actually the victim. Once the tables are turned, the smug protagonist is mortified over his or her breach of social etiquette and the theft.\n\n     By contrast, in this story, there is no significant question of etiquette; rather, the false beggar is crass and deliberately aggressive, as is the beggar bailiff. The beggar bailiff never has an opportunity to regret his subsequent actions, since he never discovers the underlying ruse. \n\n      The concept of theft functional in this story is more complicated than in the contemporary legend, since it depends on an economic interpretation of begging. Begging was seen by some as a form of theft: the receipt of goods without payment or any service rendered. In the story, that equation is made explicit in the actions of the false beggar: the theft of food right off the plate of the beggar bailiff, the person charged by the community with protecting the borders from the incursion of foreign beggars, read thieves. Yet, here, the beggar is not what he appears, and the underlying \"theft\" associated with begging is revalued by the farmer's wife, who proposes charity. \n\n     The false beggar makes explicit the implication that begging is thievery in his provocation of the beggar bailiff who reacts accordingly. His reaction, however, is rebuffed by the farmer's wife, and the beggar's bailiff is forced to relent. The farmer's wife, through her actions, paradoxically endorses a position of local charity that countermands the office of the beggar bailiff, an office that was based on the premise of surveillance, control and punishment (J\u00f8rgensen 1940; Foucault 1979). The narrative focuses on the charitable act of the farmer's wife rather than on the implicit and explicit thievery of the (false) beggar.\n\n     There is little difference between the manuscript version and the published version. In the published version, Tang Kristensen moves the reference to the beggar bailiff to the beginning of the story's orientation, downplaying the emphasis Kirsten Marie places on her father. Kirsten Marie--or perhaps Tang Kristensen--introduces a degree of confusion into the story at the end, accidentally referring to her father as \"Rasmus,\" the name that she has been using for the beggar bailiff throughout. The name is dropped in the published version.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Fader tjente i Stubdrup og s. havde de en\nStodderkonge i Nielstrup.

Revenants are also frequently conjured down into the embankments of mill ponds.\n\n     The repartee between the revenant and conjurer is common in many variants of the story, and always revolves around the conjurer's youthful transgression of stealing out of necessity rather than greed (DS V 694).

He and a farmhand were to take turns watching the animals at night, since they were roaming loose, it was during the barley planting time, since back then they sowed barley late. It was right near Rude church, and so they would go into the church entryway and lay down when they wanted to take a nap. So my grandfather had gone in there and lain down, since it was the other farmhand\u2019s turn to keep watch, and he was going about out in the fields. Then he comes running as fast as he can in to my grandfather and wakes him up and says, \u201cRas Kj\u00e6r, get up, the red ox has disappeared.\u201d Well, then he got up and when he got out of the churchyard, the other one says, \u201cOh God, I was at a plow and plowed around, I\u2019m so scared. I didn\u2019t see anything, but there was one who put me to the plow and said to me: Put that one here for me and put that one there for me. So I put my clogs down and followed along, and when I came back to my clogs, then I was free.\u201d Then the two farmhands accompanied each other out to get the animals and pull them away. It wasn\u2019t true, that the ox was missing, but he didn\u2019t dare stay out there alone any longer, and he didn\u2019t dare say anything about the revenant there in the church."}, {"story_id": 228, "full_name": "235 - 1.09 - JAH_V_724", "publication_info": "JAH_V_724", "annotation": "Kirsten Marie turns a skeptical eye toward the purported abilities of cunning folk and the widespread belief about curses and witchcraft. Deaf Lars's status is only incrementally better than that of a beggar. Many poor people survived partly through begging and partly through doing small jobs such as glazing, which were not prohibited by the trade laws. Glarmesterfolk (glaziers) was a common appellation for itinerant tinkerers and along with tatere (gypsies) and natmandsfolk (refuse collectors, literally \"nightmen\"), glarmesterfolk were often lumped under the overarching category of k\u00e6ltringer. This category included vagabonds, itinerant tinkerers and beggars. The word \"k\u00e6ltringer\" later became synonymous with \"con artists\" (Gaardboe 1968, 12-13). \n\n     Sidsel Rollands' status as a wandering beggar--and a loose woman-- also aligns well with Kirsten Marie's critical stories about beggars and members of poorer classes. In this case, the beggars are represented not only as free riders, but also as dangerous con artists.\n\n     The hare that Sidsel allegedly sees would be a \"milk hare,\" a common figure for witches either to assume or to send to collect milk from local farms (DS VII 268 and 584). Witches often steal milk and cream, perhaps the clearest manifestation of an economic product derived primarily from female coded activity, from all the local farms for their own personal gain (DS VII 576). \n\n     The farmer and his wife appeal to the community for help to pay for Sidsel's services. While she pretends to protect the farm (and by extension the community) from the threat of the witch and milk hare, she herself is actually the threat. This narrative switch is the crux of the story, where the protector turns out to be the threatener.\n\n     The prohibition against talking about the alleged cure is reminiscent of prohibitions against speaking while seeking buried treasure, an act that separates the treasure diggers from the human community (PJ 2.09). Here, the silence guarantees Sidsel some time to work her con. She even alludes to burying the money as a prophylactic against the return of the hare. It is worth noting that Sidsel, unlike the witch, steals money, a reflection of the rapid shift away from an informal economy based largely on real goods, toward a thoroughly monetized economy: This shift took place in the last decades of the nineteenth century in rural Denmark.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i M\u00f8rke og der kom D\u00f8ve Lars og en \nKj\u00e6lling h. havde til at ligge om Natten.\nh. var vist ikke gift med hende, for h. var\nskilt med hans rigtige Kone.

Other typical church destroyers are trolls and giants. The use of oxen to determine the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contrast to the communal elements of the church.

It is related to stories of the mound dwellers baking and people being kidnapped by the mound dwellers (DS I 381, 382, 832). The dance of the mound dwellers stands as a supernatural temptation, as does the seemingly seductive offer of the drink. \n\n     The farmhand is out at night--a liminal time--and far from the protection of the \"inside\" of the farm. He recognizes the threat, however, and throws the drink over his shoulder. While he escapes unscathed, the horse is injured, a recognition of just how close he has come to a bad end. His smart thinking of riding across the plowed fields, and thus inscribing a cross on the ground making it impossible for the non-Christian mound woman to pursue him, would otherwise be considered transgressive (PJ 2.03). In many stories, one finds that the best strategy for dealing with outside threat is to do something that would otherwise be considered anti-social, such as riding across freshly plowed fields. \n\n      The use of the drinking horn to support the building of a church or the use of the vessel as a chalice is a common resolution to these stories (DS I 807, 813). In those variants where the person keeps the horn for their own personal gain, the mound dwellers often return to reclaim it (DS I 796). The use of the wealth of the mound dwellers to support the community, on the other hand, is narratively lauded.\n\n     The story ends with a series of etiological tags that explain the names of local places.

There he saw so many little people and they were dancing and hopping outside the mound. So he stopped and wanted to watch what was going on and then one came over and offered him a gold [drinking] horn and invited him to drink it up. He took the horn but threw the drink behind him. Three drops landed on the back of the horse and it took both the hair and skin off the horse's back. Now the farmhand rode as fast as he could and the little people came after him with the mound hag out in front. Then he could see that he couldn't hold his own with her, so he set off across the plowed field. She couldn't run over that, she had to run around each furrow, and then she yelled out to him and said: \u201cYou should ride on the unplowed fields (boor) and not on the plowed fields (joor)\u201d and at the same time she took a clump of dirt and threw it at him. That became a mound on the field which they call Vendingsh\u00f8j [Turning mound], because she turned around at the same time, she could see that she could neither catch him nor hit him. It has later been changed to H\u00e6ningsh\u00f8j. Since he'd gotten away from her so luckily, he used the drinking horn to build Horns church, and that's how it got its name."}, {"story_id": 239, "full_name": "235 - 1.20 - DS_I_400", "publication_info": "DS_I_400", "annotation": "This story is a variant of the widely attested legends about the mound dwellers' baking, critically explored in a substantive monograph by Boberg (1938). Boberg links the mound dweller's request to the concept of the gift, an economic concept taken up by Mauss (1954). The transaction described in this legend is not, however, a gift. Rather, it is more closely related to out group barter transactions (Tangherlini 1998). Despite the penetration of a monetized economy into most aspects of Danish life in the late nineteenth century, a great deal of economic activity still relied on barter (Hvidt and Olsen 1990). The rules governing such transactions are often hard to discern, and there is often a nagging question as to whether a barter deal was \"fair.\" \n\n     In many variants, the farmhand is hesitant to eat the food proffered in return for his services, since food prepared by outsiders (in this case, presumably supernatural outsiders) can be dangerous. Accordingly, different variants explore the different strategies--and outcomes of those strategies--for dealing with the interaction (BJK 4.22; JPP 4.04). In this case, the farmhand eats the cake with the end result that things go well for him. Here, Kirsten Marie endorses the concept of out group barter transaction. Such an attitude eschews the zero-sum notion of \"limited good\" that Foster examined in the context of peasant societies (Foster 1965). Instead, Kirsten Marie proposes that the economic pie can and should be expanded. This stance aligns well with her own social position, since the farm owning class was eager to expand opportunities for economic activity beyond the local market town.", "danish_manuscript": "Henne i Voldum var en Karl der drev og\npl\u00f8jede imellem Voldum og Hvall\u00f8s og der laa\nen bitte H\u00f8j og s. kom der, mens h. var hene\nved den anden Ende en Raag og den var i\n\n5216A\nstkker.

Even though the practice was banned because of the significant damage that the animals did to the fields, the ban was hard to enforce. As the parceling of fields was completed, more substantial fences and walls were erected, and more consistent techniques in fertilizing, drainage, and crop rotation were implemented. Ultimately, the practice of uncontrolled grazing was abandoned.\n\n     The story plays on the stereotype of the foolish Molbo. Tang Kristensen published several volumes of these stories, inspired in part by Tuxen's earlier collection of similar stories (1866). \n\n     In this and the following story, Tang Kristensen tried to capture Kirsten Marie's use of dialect.

His account offers a small window into the otherwise hidden world of the itinerant population of natmandsfolk (refuse collectors; nightmen).\n\n      The distinction that Kirsten Marie draws between the rakker (knacker) and the gjelder (gelder) is a subtle one. Christian II's law for towns required that every market town should have a knacker (rakker) and an executioner (b\u00f8ddel). Over the years, the distinction between the executioner and the knacker became more distinct, with the executioner only having responsibility for executions and the knacker having a broader series of responsibilities, including the burial of suicides and the hung, flaying of animals that died (instead of being slaughtered), cleaning sewers and the like. \n\n      Subsequently, the term rakker (knacker) became a common appellation in the eastern and southern parts of Vendsyssel (northern Jutland) for people engaged in all the jobs considered \"dirty,\" such as flaying, chimney sweeping and the gelding of animals (Gaardboe 1968, 18). In northern Vendsyssel, the common appelation was \"natfolk\" or \"natmandsfolk,\" because the jobs they did were ostensibly carried out at night under the cover of darkness, or were otherwise hidden from view: the cleaning of latrines, the burial of suicides, and the like. \n\n      Both the knacker and the gelder were members of the lowest social class, albeit above the class of unemployed or unemployable poor. They were often buried in the least desirable part of the cemetery, namely the northern end.\n\n     The various laws concerning begging and poverty assistance did little for this class of itinerant workers. At the same time, they ignored laws concerning commerce that would bar them from selling knick-knacks or working as craftsmen at the farms they visited. \n\n     Natmandsfolk were ethnically Danish, in contrast to other itinerant groups, referred to as tatere (gypsies), a term used for foreign wanderers irrespective of their heritage, or glarmesterfolk (glaziers), who were often not of Danish heritage (Gaarboe 1968, 12-13). \n\n     A significant amount of scholarship has focused on the life and hard times of the various itinerant populations in Denmark in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Perhaps one of the best known and earliest of these studies was Me\u00efr Goldschmidt's study of wanderers and outsiders in Denmark (1867). Dyrlund's study of gypsies and other itinerants is considered to be the first significant historical study of this phenomenon (1872). Earlier, Sundt undertook a similar study in Norway (1850). While a small number of these people were gypsies, the vast majority were ethnic Danes who for various reasons had dropped out of society and had become vagabonds.", "danish_manuscript": "I Hvall\u00f8s boede en Rakker og en Gjaller.\nRakkeren [var] og hans Kone og havde ingen B\u00f8rn\nmen Gjalleren havde to, en Datter og en S\u00f8n.\nS. var der en Karl der tjente der i Byen.\nh. tjente hans Faster.

Nevertheless, animals might well be spooked by, and stampede at, the sight and sounds of a bee swarm. \n\n     A bee swarm usually indicates overcrowding in the hive and the queen bee often leaves the hive during a swarm. Consequently, a swarm might reduce honey production, and it would be important to any beekeeper to quell the swarm quickly and effectively. The swarm might also choose to move to another hive not on the beekeeper's property. Putting the swarm into a stone heap might be a temporary solution, but it would do little to help with honey production at the farm.\n\n     Tang Kristensen noted that the word toend\u00e9, written as one word in the manuscript, but as three words in the published version, is incomprehensible.

This family became the most famous family of cunning folk in Denmark. There are numerous stories related to their practice in Danske sagn (DS VI 882, 886).\n\n    Up through the nineteenth century, there was considerable competition among cunning folk. Because of strict laws against quacksalvery and practicing medicine without a license, cunning folk often relied on word of mouth to support their practices. Despite the laws, authorities often \"looked the other way\" at these practices since the cunning folk represented, in many cases, the only access to health care for many people living in rural areas. Indeed, the Haaning family had a close working relationship with the pharmacy in L\u00f8gst\u00f8r (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 105). \n\n     Stories such as this attest to the considerable discussion among the rural population not only of whether the cunning folk could help but also about which cunning folk were worth visiting.

He came in and said that the child would be hung. Yes, well then he shouldn't be born yet. Then he asked him a little later to go out. Said he would be burned. Not born yet either. Go out again. He said he would inherit the Ridesvends peddler. Well then he could be born. Then the Ridesvends peddler in the other bed thought that that would be quite a lie, was going to make sure that it wouldn't happen. Went off. When the child got bigger, he got hold of him and he was to be with him. He was a peddler and he followed along with him. One day he wrote a letter and sent him home with it and they should kill him. Along the way, he came past a cemetery, lay down there and slept and put the letter under his head. Then they came out of the church, and the minister went over and saw what was written in the letter. He wrote another letter, that they should try to have a wedding celebration as quickly as possible, and he put it quietly back into the envelope. They had the celebration and everything was done and ready when he got home. The outriders' peddler killed himself and then he inherited from him.", "danish_publication": "I den Tid, da Vorherre og Sant-Peder de gik paa Jorden, da kom de en Aften til et Sted og bad om Hus. De fik ogsaa Lov til at ligge der, men kort i Forvejen var Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer ogsaa kommen dertil og havde forlangt Nattely, og ham havde de ogsaa huset. Han var nu allerede gaaet ti Ro, og saa kom Vorherre og Sant-Peder ogsaa til Ro, men de laa da hver i sin Seng. Lidt efter h\u00f8rte de, te Konen i Huset hun kom i Barnsn\u00f8d. Saa siger Vorherre og til Sant-Peder: \u201dGaa ud og se, hvad Stj\u00e6rner der er paa Himmelen.\u201d Han gik og kom ind igjen og fortalte det. \u201dJa, saa kan det ikke gaa an at lade Barnet blive f\u00f8dt endnu, for hvis det nu blev f\u00f8dt, saa skulde det h\u00e6nges.\u201d Konen hun laa nu og klagede sig der inde, og saa et Stykke Tid efter siger Vorherre igjen til Sant-Peder, at han skal gaa ud og se efter, hvad Stj\u00e6rner der er nu paa Himmelen. Han kommer tilbage og fort\u00e6ller det. \u201dNej, saa kan det ikke gaa an endnu, for hvis Barnet nu blev f\u00f8dt, saa skuld det br\u00e6ndes.\u201d Der gaar igjen en Tid og Konen ligger og klager sig jammerlig. \u201dNu kan du gaa ud og se igjen.\u201d Han gaar og kommer tilbage og fort\u00e6ller, hvad han har set. \u201dJa, nu kan det gaa,\u201d siger Vorherre, \u201dfor naar det nu bliver f\u00f8dt, saa skal den komme til at arve Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer.\u201d Saa maatte Drengen altsaa blive f\u00f8dt, og han blev det ogsaa. Nu laa Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer jo i den anden Seng, og han laa og h\u00f8rte det. Saa t\u00e6nkte han: \u201dDet skal blive en farlig L\u00f8gn, det skal a nok se at faa forb\u00f8jen.\u201d Om Morgenen rejste han derfra igjen, og Vorherre og Sant-Peder gjorde ogsaa. Barnet vokste godt til og blev en dygtig Dreng. Nu havde Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer jo hans Opm\u00e6rksomhed henvendt paa den Dreng, og saa kommer han en Gang tilbage dertil og forlanger at faa den Dreng. Han foregav, han skulde f\u00f8lge med ham ud at handle og da faa det saa og saa godt. Han fortalte jo, han var Kr\u00e6mmer, og For\u00e6ldrene tykte godt om hans Forslag og lod ham faa Drengen. Der gik nogle Dage hen, og Drengen havde det godt nok. Men saa skriver Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer en Dag et Brev, og det skulde han gaa hjem til hans Kone og Datter med, og han gav ham jo Besked om Vejen. I det Brev stod der, at naar Overbringeren af det Brev kom, saa skulde de slaa ham ihjel, og det skulde gj\u00f8res saa betids, at han kunde v\u00e6re henne, inden Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer kom hjem. Han gaar saa med Brevet, det gj\u00f8r Drengen, men det var en lang Vej, og han blev tr\u00e6t. Saa kom han forbi en Kirkegaard, og der kom han i Tanker om at gaa ind og l\u00e6gge sig lidt for at hvile, og han lagde Brevet under hans Hoved. Men nu var han jo saa tr\u00e6t, og da han saadan ligger, falder han i S\u00f8vn. Nu var det netop en S\u00f8ndag, og der var Tjeneste i Kirken. Den Gang Folkene kom ud, var der nogle, der saa den Dreng, og de gaar hen og fort\u00e6ller Pr\u00e6sten det. Han kommer saa hen til ham og ser paa ham, og saa faar han ogsaa det Brev at se, der ligger under hans Hoved. Han lister sig til at faa fat i det og br\u00e6kker det og l\u00e6ser, hvad der staar. Da f\u00f8ler han jo Medynk med den kj\u00f8nne Dreng og gaar ind og skriver Brevet om, saa der kommer til at staa, at de skulde give Overbringeren af Brevet Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmers Datter snarest mulig, og de skulde str\u00e6be saadan med at have Gilde, at det hele kunde v\u00e6re til Side, inden han selv kommer hjem. Han stak nu saa lettelig Brevet ind under Drengens Hoved igjen, og saa gik de hver til sit. Naa, Drengen vaagnede omsider, og saa kom han afsted igjen, og kom endelig hjem til Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmers Hus og gav hans Kone Brevet. Hun l\u00e6ste, hvad der stod, og fik nu travlt med at faa det ordnet. Men de fik da Gilde og alting var klappet og klart, da Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer kom hjem. Han blev jo saa flyvegal, da han h\u00f8rte, hvad der var gaaet for sig. Men Konen viste ham jo Brevet, og saa kunde han jo selv se, hvad han havde skrevet saa hun havde ingen Skyld i det. Han blev nu saa \u00e6rgerlig, at han gik hen og tog sig selv af med Livet, og saa arvede Drengen jo det hele, der var ingen n\u00e6rere til det, og saadan gik det i Opfyldelse, hvad Vorherre havde sagt.\n\nNavnet blev indtalt: Riisvends Kr\u00e6mer.

They were given permission to stay there, but a short time earlier the Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer (The Outrider\u00b4s Peddler) had also arrived there and had asked for lodgings, and they had also given him quarter. He had already gone to bed, and then Our Lord and Saint Peter also went to bed, but they lay each in their own bed. A little later they heard that the woman of the house had gone into labor. Then Our Lord says to Saint Peter: \u201cGo out and see which stars are in the heavens.\u201d He went out and came back in again and told him. \u201cWell, then we can\u2019t let the child be born yet, because if it is born now, then it will be hung.\u201d So the woman lies complaining in there some more, and then a little bit later, Our Lord once again tells Saint Peter to go out and see which stars are in the heavens. He comes back and tells him. \u201cNo, it still isn\u2019t right, because if the child was born now, then it would be burned.\u201d A little time goes by again, and the woman is still lying in there complaining horribly. \u201cNow you can go out and look again.\u201d He comes back and tells him what he has seen. \u201cYes, now it is OK,\u201d says Our Lord, \u201cbecause when the child is born now, then he will inherit from the Outrider\u2019s Peddler. Then the boy could be born, and he was. Now the Outrider\u2019s Peddler lay in the other bed, and he lay there and listened to this. Then he thought to himself: \u201cThat will be one heck of a lie, I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d The next morning, he left again, and Our Lord and Saint Peter did too. The child grew up well and became a clever lad. Now the Outrider\u2019s Peddler had focused his attention on the boy, and so one time he comes back to that place and asks to have the boy. He told them that he was a peddler, and the parents liked his proposal and they let him have the boy. A couple of days passed, and the boy was doing fine. But then one day the Outrider\u2019s Peddler writes a letter, and the boy was to take it home to the peddler's wife and daughter, and he told him how to get there. It was written in the letter that when the bearer of the letter arrived they were to kill him, and it should be done so quickly that he would be dead before the Outrider\u2019s Peddler came home. So he walks off with the letter, the boy does, but it was a long way, and he gets tired. So he walks past a cemetery, and he decided to go in and lie down a bit to take a rest, and he put the letter under his head. But he was so tired that when he lay down like that, he fell asleep. Now it turned out that it was a Sunday, and there were services in the church. When the people came out, there were some who saw the boy, and they go off and tell the minister that. He comes over to him, and then he also notices the letter which is under his head. Stealthily, he gets a hold of it and opens it and reads what it says. Now he feels a great deal of sympathy for the beautiful boy and goes inside and rewrites the letter so that it says that they should give the bearer of the letter the Outrider Peddler\u2019s daughter as his bride as soon as possible, and exert themselves to have a wedding banquet so that it can all be done by the time he comes home. He now carefully put the letter back under the boy\u2019s head again, and then they all left. Well, the boy woke up after a while, and then he set off again, and finally he gets to the Outrider Peddler\u2019s house and gave the peddler\u2019s wife the letter. She read what it said, and now got busy arranging everything. They had the wedding banquet and had everything done free and clear by the time the Outrider\u2019s Peddler came home. He became so crazed with anger when he heard what had happened. But his wife showed him the letter, and he could see for himself what he had written, she had no fault in this. He became so aggravated that he went and killed himself, and then the boy inherited all of it, there were no closer relatives, and that\u2019s how what Our Lord had said was fulfilled.\n\nThe name was recorded as: Riisvends Kr\u00e6mer.

The sultan's dalliance with the grocer's daughter leads to a confusion of social rank and status for the ensuing boy child, and this confusion animates the rest of the tale. The boy's dalliance with the viceroy's daughter is the inverse of his father's earlier peccadillo. He relies on his father's token to save his life, and to assume his rightful place in the social hierarchy. Presumably, he will also inherit from the sultan.\n\n     Kirsten Marie is keenly aware of class differences in her storytelling. Holbek suggests that fairy tales in Denmark are not so much about kings and queens, but more about the nuanced distinction between the very poor, the poor and the moderately well off, such as farm owners (Holbek 1987). In other stories, it is exactly this tension between these various economic and social classes that informs Kirsten Marie's storytelling. Here, the dialectic is incorporated into a fictional tale; the class differences--and the punishments--are more extreme than in her legends, but the folktale has a generic tendency toward extremes (Holbek 1987).\n\n     Tang Kristensen rightfully classifies this tale as a fairy tale. Although it has many similarities with ATU 873, \"The King Discovers His Unknown Son\", it diverges quite substantially from the tale's general outline in the ATU index. The sultan does not marry the boy's mother, but instead the boy is allowed to marry the viceroy's daughter and, subsequent to the viceroy's execution, inherits the title and, presumably, half the kingdom.

When the boy had gotten bigger and had started going to school, he came home one day and says to his mother, Mother, they call me a bastard. That you are, my boy, she says. Don't you know where my father is. No, she didn't know. Yes, well then he wanted to go out and look for his father. Then he traveled off and got work with a p\u00e2t\u00e9 baker and he was to deliver p\u00e2t\u00e9 to the viceroy. Then this boy always had to go up there with the p\u00e2t\u00e9. The king had a daughter and she develops a soft spot for the boy. The baker had now taken him in as their own. The Sultan was traveling about at that time and was disguised and he came there to the viceroy and asked him if he didn't want to have a look around and be disguised. They went out together and went and listened to and asked about one thing and the other. Then the Sultan noticed that this young man had a soft spot for the daughter. So they were (disguised as) pilgrims and came to the baker's and asked for lodgings. They said they were welcome to stay there, in the young man's room, as long as it was OK with him. After they'd lain in bed for a while, the daughter came in to him. The king recognized his daughter and the Sultan kept poking him in his side, he was to lay still and keep his mouth shut. Then they left the next morning and the King was so mad at the young man, but the Sultan asked him not to forbid them from seeing each other. The Sultan journeyed off and the king was to be in charge of everything while he was gone. There was a bridge the young man had to cross when he was to come with the p\u00e2t\u00e9, and the king put two men there as guards and they were to kill him and come and show him blood on their swords. Then they jumped him and he realized he was going to be killed, he took his mark up and showed them. Then they said to each other that that was the Sultan's own seal, and so no one could touch him. But he had a little dog, so they stabbed that to death and then they showed the king the blood on their swords and showed him that he was dead now. Then he was supposed to hide and he wasn't to come out until the Sultan came home again. When the Sultan came home the guard went to him with the young man's mark. Then he says, What, did you murder him? Yes, we were told to do so by the viceroy, but they hadn't done it. Then he asked them to bring him out immediately and they did that and then he asked the viceroy if he didn't think his son was good enough for his daughter. Then they attached six horses to him and he was dragged to death.

Nu gjorde Sultanen sig gode Venner med hende, og det endte da med, at hun blev frugtsommelig.

One evening he arrives at the house of a wealthy grocer and he lodges with him that night. The grocer had but one daughter and no other children. Now the sultan made himself good friends with her, and it ended up that she got pregnant. When he left, he gave her a thing that she was to bind on the child when it was born, and then he said that if the child ever found itself in danger, then he was to show that badge, and then there was no one who would dare do anything to him. The child was born, and it was a boy, and when he got a little bigger, he went to school. One day he came home and said to his mother: \u201cMother, they call me a whore\u2019s child.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, you sort of are, my boy,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who my father is?\u201d No, she didn\u2019t know. Well, then he wanted to go out into the world and look for his father. So he journeys off, and he started working for a p\u00e2t\u00e9 baker, and the baker's family came to like him so much that they took him in as their own. That baker was to make p\u00e2t\u00e9 for the viceroy, and this boy was always sent up there with the p\u00e2t\u00e9. He grew up, and then the viceroy had a daughter, who felt kindness for the boy. The sultan continued traveling about and was always disguised. Then he comes to the viceroy\u2019s place and asks him if he didn\u2019t want to journey about as well and inspect the country, they could accompany each other, and then he was to be disguised too. He said he\u2019d be happy to go along with that, and so theyaccompanied each other and they listened and asked about this and that. They had disguised themselves as pilgrims, and they came one evening to the p\u00e2t\u00e9 baker\u2019s place and asked for lodgings. Well, the baker said that he had a journeyman, and they could stay in his room if it was OK by him, but they didn\u2019t have any other room. They really wanted to stay there, and the young man was asked and he gave them permission to stay in his room with him. Then these pilgrims go to bed, and they had lain there a short while, and the young man thought they were sleeping, and so he opened up for a girl who came to him and it was no other than the viceroy\u2019s daughter. Her father could easily recognize her and he had a hard time controlling himself, but the sultan kept poking him in the side, telling him to lie still and stay quiet. After she\u2019d been there a while, she left again and the viceroy was very angry at the young man, and he wanted to speak seriously with him about it in the morning, but the sultan asked him not to forbid the two from seeing each other. Then the sultan was to go on a longer journey abroad, and while he was gone, the viceroy was to be in charge of everything. There was a bridge that the young man had to cross each time he was to go up to the castle with p\u00e2t\u00e9, and two workers were placed on it with the order that, when he came, they were to grab him and kill him, and as evidence that they had carried out the mission, they were to come and show him the blood on their sword. They grabbed him too, but when he realized that they were going to hurt him and kill him, he took his badge up and showed it to them. They said to each other: \u201cThat\u2019s the sultan\u2019s own seal, no one can touch him.\u201d But they had a little dog along with them, so they took it and stabbed it to death. With that, the viceroy calmed down. But the young man understood that he needed to hide until the sultan came home, because otherwise things would go bad for him and the guards. When the sultan came back, the guards went up to him with the young man\u2019s badge. Then he says, \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d Well, a young man who they were supposed to murder had given it to them. \u201cSo, did you murder him?\u201d Well, the viceroy had ordered them to do it, but they hadn\u2019t. Then he asked them to bring the young man to him immediately, so he could make sure that that was true. They did that too, and then he could tell that it was his own son. He sent for the viceroy and asked him if he didn\u2019t think that his son was good enough for his daughter. After that, he decreed that the viceroy should be attached to six horses, and then be dragged to death. After that, the sultan held a wedding for them, and then his son became the next viceroy after the other one."}, {"story_id": 269, "full_name": "235 - 1.49 - JFm_XII_3", "publication_info": "JFm_XII_3", "annotation": "This fairy tale, a variant of ATU 562, \"The Spirit in the Blue Light\", is the longest of all Kirsten Marie's stories. It follows the model of an active, masculine tale (Holbek 1987, 432-3). The main tension in the tale exists between generations on the low level, namely the tension between the soldier and the old woman who wants not only the genie, but the soldier's death. The lion, who appears as a magical helper figure early on in the tale, reappears at the very end of the tale as the soldier's love interest. \n\n     The tale departs radically from the progression of moves proposed by Holbek. The soldier is presumably already an adult by the time he encounters the lion, having served as a soldier for thirty years--thus the tale lacks the standard young male protagonist at low level. The obvious donor role played by the lion aligns with Holbek's move two. The old woman the soldier encounters may well be a manifestation of the tension at high level that has changed the princess into a lion. His successful completion of the task confirms his status as an adult; the riches he has won suggest a move to high level, but the riches often precede change in actual status. The interlude with the false princess and the false king is reminiscent of Holbek's move four. Ultimately, he returns for the lion, discovers her true nature, marries her, and the fairy tale concludes with the union of the now high status adult male with the high status now adult female.\n\n     Prior to the constitutional reforms, military service was an obligation that only accrued to the peasant class. Serving thirty years in the military, however, was an unusually long time. While Paris is most likely used by Kirsten Marie as a referent to a far off, and luxurious land, it is possible that the choice of Paris was more conscious. Urban elites in Copenhagen were well aware of what was going on in Paris, as were many of the better off farmers. Indeed, Paris, the court of the French kings, and the political currents coming from Paris had become a part of the average Danish consciousness already with the Napoleonic wars--and Denmark's disastrous role in the war--since the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\n     Tang Kristensen included the story in his third volume of \u00c6ventyr fra Jylland (JF XII 3).

But then he'd dreamed three nights in a row that he was to be king in Paris. He went and asked to be discharged. They said that he was a fool, because he'd never become that. Was discharged and journeyed off anyway. It was so hot and he had gotten thirsty, went into a forest where a stream ran, lay down and wanted to drink. Then there was a lion lying there on the other side and it laughed at him, when he stood up. What are you laughing at. I'm laughing that you want to be king in Paris. You're going to become king, too, but it is going to be after a lot of shit. Now you're to go through three forests and then someone will come to you and ask if you don't want to have him as a servant, but you may not take him. Then another one will come, but you shouldn't take him either. But the third one you should take as your servant, he'll be true to you. Now you have something that can never be taken. Money. Now when you get out into the middle of the forest, you'll come to a house, you are to go in there. Here is a hat, too, when you spin it, it shoots off two hundred cannon salvos out of each corner of the triangle, and here is a sword, everything that you bare its edges to will fall. -- There is an old bitty, she will want you to go and get the lamp that is burning down in the cellar. She'll want you to give it to her before you get back up, because then she'll let you fall down in there and then she'll kill you. You need to bring it up with you. There's a big genie down there. As soon as you light the lamp, wherever you may be, then the genie will come and he'll give you whatever you ask for. But when it comes to honor and worth, remember me. Then he journeyed on. When he'd gone a while, a young man came up to him and asked if he didn't want him as his servant. But he said no to that. Then he came to the second. He said no as well. To the third. Could he have him as a servant. Servant, you don't need a servant, since he'd gotten to the house first and got the lamp. Then he answers and said it didn't matter either way to him and then he reaches down in his pocket and took a handful of money and gave it to him. Then he wanted to be his servant when he saw that he had enough money. Then he came to this little house, and he went in and there was no one there but an old woman, who was sitting in there. Then he said, good evening, Mutter. Good evening, little son, are you here, I've waited for you for so long. Can't you go down to the cellar and bring up the wall lamp that's burning down there for me. So he went down and there was this genie. Then she shouted: Oh, give me the lamp, little son, I'm afraid you're going to break it. No, I'll take care of it, he said. Then he came up and showed the edge of his sword to her and she lay and was dead, and then he journeyed off with it. Then he said to his servant, Can you show us the best inn there is in Paris. Oh, god help us, he said, we'd better go to one of the simpler places. No, he wanted to go to the very best. Then he showed him up to one that was right across from the king's castle. Then that evening as they sat there, he said, what's that music we can hear. Oh, that's the king's daughter who is playing piano. Then he lit the lamp and then the genie stood before him. What do you wish my lord. I wish that you would get me a piano, twice as good as the one she is playing. So then he started to play on it the next day and the princess hears it. He sold it to her and for a lot of money and got quite a bit for it. Then he lit his lamp again and the genie stood before him again. What do you wish my lord. I want you to get me the princess to come over here for an hour each night. Yes, that would happen. Now it was discovered and they tie a bag of peas around her neck because they want to see where she goes. They could tell that she wasn't sleeping soundly at night. But the king becomes so desperate when he sees this and he puts him in the tower next door. Then he sat in there and there was a guard in front there. He asks the guard if he can't call for his servant because he had his lighter and he couldn't light his lamp. No, said the guard, he didn't dare do that. He reaches down in his pocket and takes a handful of money and passes it out the slot to him. Then he got him and then he lit his lamp and then the genie stands before him. What do you wish... I want you to build me a tower twice as high as this one before morning. Things get very busy but the next morning, the king woke up and he rubbed his eyes when he looked out and saw the giant tower. Then the king got scared and now he didn't dare deny him his daughter any longer. He married her and then he asked her to give him his hat and his sword and then he told her what qualities they had. Then she had ones just like them made and then the king ordered everyone to war and then this prince was to go out and fight, but he didn't want to have any soldiers, he could do it himself. He asked her for his hat and sword and she gave them to him. When he came out to the enemy, he spun his hat and said fire, but no it wouldn't fire. Then he realized he'd been tricked. He showed them his sword, but that didn't serve him either. Then he was captured and they made a giant bonfire and he was to be burned there. Then he asked if he couldn't have a pipe before he was to be burned, and they thought it was a shame to deny the Prince that. Asked if he couldn't light it with his own lighter. Was allowed to do so. Then his servant came with it and then he lit the lamp and then the genie stood there before him, and then he said, what do you wish my lord. I want you to cut all these soldiers down at their knees. He did that too and then he went in to his wife and then she was so sad and that she had made a mistake, and then she came with the real ones and gave them to him. Then he showed her the edge of his sword and then she lay there and was dead on account of her betrayal. Then he journeyed off to the lion who lay by the stream. Will you now chop my head off she said. He didn't want to do that, but he did it and then she was a much wished for Princess and so he married her and he became king in Paris and lived well.", "danish_publication": "Der var en Soldat, der havde v\u00e6ret 30 Aar i Tjenesten. Saa kunde han snart have kommet til at faa Pension, men da dr\u00f8mte han i tre N\u00e6tter i Tr\u00e6k, at han skulde v\u00e6re Konge i Paris, og saa gik han hen og forlangte hans Afsked. De sagde, at han var en Nar, der saadan vilde lade hans Pension gaa fra sig for den Dr\u00f8ms Skuld, for den gik aldrig i Opfyldelse. Saa fik han hans Afsked og rejste lige godt. Det var saa varmt i Vejret, og han blev t\u00f8rstig, men da han saa kommer ind i en Skov, hvor der l\u00f8ber en B\u00e6k, saa l\u00e6gger han sig ned og vil drikke. Men da ligger der en L\u00f8ve ved den anden Side af B\u00e6kken og ler ad ham, da han rejser sig igjen. \"Hvad ler du ad?\" siger han. \"A ler ad, at du vil v\u00e6re Konge i Paris. Det bliver du ogsaa, men det sker kun med stor M\u00f8je. Nu skal du igjennem tre Skove, og der kommer da \u00e9n til dig i den f\u00f8rste Skov og sp\u00f8rger, om du vil ikke have ham til Tjener, men ham maa du ikke tage. Saa kommer du i den anden Skov, og der kommer atter \u00e9n til dig og tilbyder sig at ville v\u00e6re din Tjener, men ham skal du heller ikke tage. Endelig kommer du i den tredje Skov, og den tredje, der da kommer til dig, ham skal du tage til Tjener, for han vil v\u00e6re dig tro, og det gj\u00e6lder det saa meget for dig om. Der har du nu en Pung, den kan aldrig fattes Penge, og saa har du der et Sv\u00e6rd, alt det, du viser Eggen af det, det falder. Saa har du ogsaa her en hat, den er trekantet, som du ser, og naar du snor den, saa flyver der 200 Kanonskud ud af hvert hj\u00f8rne. Naar du kommer nu midt ind i den sidste Skov, saa kommer du til et hus, og der skal du gaa ind. Der er en gammel Kj\u00e6lling, og hun vil have dig ned at hente et Lys, der staar og br\u00e6nder nede i Kj\u00e6lderen. Det skal du gaa ned og tage men hun vil forlange det af dig, inden du kommer op. Du skal imidlertid ikke lade hende faa det, for saa lader hun dig platte ned i Kj\u00e6lderen igjen, og saa kv\u00e6ler hun dig. Du skal tage det op med dig og beholde det. Der ligger en stor Staalmand der nede i den Kj\u00e6lder, ham kan du kalde til dig, hvor som helst du er, saa snart du t\u00e6nder Ild i det Lys, for saa kommer han og sp\u00f8rger om, hvad du befaler, og saa kan du altid faa af ham, hvad du begj\u00e6rer. Men for det a har nu givet dig Underretning om det, saa beder a dig om, at du kommer mig i hu, naar du kommer til \u00c6re og V\u00e6rdighed\". Ja, det lovede han, og saa rejste han videre.\nDa han kommer saa et Stykke hen, saa kommer den f\u00f8rste Karl til ham og sp\u00f8rger, om han vil ikke have ham til Tjener. Men det siger han nej til. Saa kommer han i den anden Skov, og der kommer atter \u00e9n til ham. Ham vilde han heller ikke have. Endelig i den tredje Skov, da han kommer til den tredje Karl, sp\u00f8rger han, om han kunde ikke faa ham til Tjener. \"Tjener! du tr\u00e6nger saam\u00e6nd ingen Tjener for\". Jo, han vilde da gj\u00e6rne have ham, og saa r\u00e6kker han ned i Pungen og tager en haandfuld Penge og giver ham. Ja, saa vilde han ogsaa nok v\u00e6re Tjener for ham, han saa jo, at han havde Penge nok, og saa fulgtes han med ham. De kommer saa til dether lille hus, som L\u00f8ven havde talt om, og der gik Soldaten ind. Der var ikke andre der inde end en gammel Kone, og han sagde: \"God Aften Mutter!\" \u2014 \"God Aften, S\u00e6nle, (S\u00f8nlille) svarer hun, \"er du der? A har ventet efter dig saa l\u00e6nge. Vil du ikke gaa ned i Kj\u00e6lderen og tage mig det Vogslys op, der staar og br\u00e6nder?\" Jo, saa gik han ogsaa derned. Der laa denher store Staalmand. Da han nu havde taget Lyset og vilde op igjen, raaber hun: \"Aa, giv mig Lyset, S\u00e6nte, a er r\u00e6d, du faar det i Stykker.\" \u2014 \"Nej, a skal nok passe paa det,\" siger han, og saa kom han op med det i haanden, og saa viste han hende Eggen af hans Sabel. Da laa hun strags og var d\u00f8d. Saa rejste han videre med Lyset og hans andre Sager.\nDa de kom saa ud af Skoven, var de i N\u00e6rheden af Paris. Saa Siger han til hans Tjener: \"Kan du vise os den villeste Gj\u00e6stgivergaard, der er her i Paris?\" -- \"Aa, Gud hj\u00e6lp os,\" siger han, \"vi maa hellere gaa paa en af de simple, den villeste er alt for dyr.\" Nej, de vilde paa den alvilleste. Saa viste Tjeneren ham ogsaa en, der laa lige overfor Kongens Slot, og der kom de ind.\nOm Aftingen, de sad, saa siger han den gamle soldat: \"Hvad er det for en Musik, vi kan h\u00f8re?\" \u2014 \"Aa, det er Kongens Datter, der spiller paa Klaver.\" Saa t\u00e6nder han hans Lys, og da staar Staalmanden for ham. \"Hvad begj\u00e6rer min Herre?\" \u2014 \"A begj\u00e6rer, at du skal skaffe mig et Klaver dobbelt saa godt som det, Prinsessen spiller paa.\" Naa ja, Staalmanden rejste af og kom snart med det. Saa gav han sig til at spille paa det Aftenen efter, og prinsessen h\u00f8rer paa det. Saa kommer hun og vil kj\u00f8be det af ham. Nej, han vilde ikke s\u00e6lge det, men da hun b\u00f8d ham mange Penge for det, saa lod han hende endelig faa det. Aftenen efter t\u00e6ndte han hans Lys igjen, og Staalmanden kommer og sp\u00f8rger: \"Hvad begj\u00e6rer min Herre?\" \u2014 \"A begj\u00e6rer, du skal skaffe mig Prinsessen her over en Time hver Nat.\" Ja, det skulde Ske, og hun kom ogsaa. Staalmanden hentede hende hver eneste Aften. Nu kunde de nok m\u00e6rke, hun havde en urolig S\u00f8vn om Natten, og de blev ogsaa kloge paa, at hun blev hentet et andet Sted hen. For nu at faa det opdaget, hvor hun rejste hen, bandt de en Pose \u00c6rter om hendes hals, og saa fandt de ud af det. Der var jo hul paa Posen, og \u00c6rterne viste dem Vej. Kongen blev saa desperat, da han saa, hvor hun havde v\u00e6ret, at han lod Soldaten s\u00e6tte ind i et Taarn ved Siden af Slottet, og der blev sat Skildvagt for ham. Saa sad han jo der inde, og saa beder han Skildvagten om at kalde ad hans Tjener, for han kunde ikke faa hans Lys t\u00e6ndt, og Tjeneren havde hans Fyrt\u00f8j. Nej, siger Skildvagten, det turde han ikke. Saa r\u00e6kker han ned i Lommen og tager en haandfuld Penge, og flyr dem ud ad Spr\u00e6kken til ham. Det hjalp, og saa hentede han Tjeneren. Soldaten beder ham om at hente Fyrt\u00f8jet, og da han faar det, saa t\u00e6nder han Lyset, og da staar Staalmanden for ham igjen. \"Hvad befaler min Herre?\" -- \"A befaler, du skal bygge mig et Taarn inden Dag, og det Skal v\u00e6re dobbelt saa Stort som dether, og staa ved Siden af, lige uden for Kongens Vinduer.\" Naa, der blev travlt, men om Morgenen, da Kongen han vaagnede og kom til at se ud, da maatte han gnide hans \u00d8jne, for han saa det store Taarn og kunde aldrig begribe, hvor det kom fra. Han h\u00f8rer, og han frager, og endelig bliver det da oplyst, at det er Soldaten, der har ladet det bygge om Natten. Nu blev Kongen r\u00e6d og turde ikke n\u00e6gte ham hans Datter l\u00e6ngere.\nHan bliver saa gift med hende. Saa beder han hende om at gjemme (putte) hans Hat og hans Sv\u00e6rd, og han fortalte hende, hvad Egenskab der var ved det. Saa fik hun Magen til lavet og havde det i Beredskab, og ingen kunde kjende det fra hverandt. Da gaar det saadan, at der kommer Krig paa, og denher Prins, for nu var Soldaten jo bleven Prins, han skulde ud at slaas. Men han vilde ingen krigsfolk have med, han kunde nok Selv gj\u00f8re det ud, sagde han. Da han drog af, bad han hans Kone, om hun vilde fly ham hans Hat og hans Sv\u00e6rd, og saa kom hun med de Dele, hun havde ladet lave. Da han kom nu ud til Fjenden, snoebe han Hatten og sagde: \"Fyr!\" men nej, den vilde ikke fyre. Saa m\u00e6rkede han, han var narret. Han viste dem Sv\u00e6rdet, men det vilde heller ikke gj\u00f8re Tjeneste. Enden paa det blev, at han blev fanget, og der blev et stort sv\u00e6rt Baal stilt an, som han skulde br\u00e6ndes paa. Da han nu stod paa Baalet, bad han, om han maatte da ikke faa en pibe Tobak, inden han skulde br\u00e6ndes, og det tykte de da var Synd at n\u00e6gte Prinsen. Han bad dern\u00e6st, om han maatte ikke t\u00e6nde ved hans eget Fyrt\u00f8j, og det fik han Lov til. Saa kom hans Tjener med det, og saa t\u00e6ndte han Lyset, og saa stod Staalmanden for ham igjen. Han sagde: \"Hvad befaler min Herre?\" \u2014 \"A befaler, du skal slaa mig alle hele de Krigsfolk af i Kn\u00e6erne!\" Det gjorde han, og saa var Prinsen fri. Nu rejste han hjem til hans Kone, og hun var da saa meget s\u00f8rgen, lod hun, hun havde saadan og saadan taget fejl og havde saadan fortr\u00f8dt det. Her var nu det rigtige, og saa flyede hun ham det. Saa viste han hende Eggen af hans Sabel, og da laa hun og var d\u00f8d for hendes Utroskabs Skyld. Nu var han i hans V\u00e6rdighed igjen, og saa kom han i Tanker om L\u00f8ven, der havde v\u00e6ret saa god ved ham og endnu laa ved B\u00e6kken og ventede. Saa rejste han hen til hende, og hun blev glad, da hun saa ham, og sagde: \"Vil du nu hugge mit Hoved af?\" Det var han ikke for, men da hun bad ham meget om det, saa gjorde han det, og saa blev hun til en skj\u00f8n Prinsesse, der havde v\u00e6ret for\u00f8nsket. Saa holdt han Bryllup med hende, og de levede al deres Tid som Konge og Dronning i Paris, og havde det godt.\n", "english_publication": "Once there was a soldier who had served in the army for thirty years. He was soon going to be eligible to receive a pension but then he dreamed three nights in a row that he was going to become king in Paris, and so he went and asked to be discharged. They said that he was a fool, leaving his pension for the sake of a dream because it would never come true. Then he was discharged and he traveled off. \n     The weather was very warm and he got thirsty, so he went into a forest where there was a stream, and he lay down to drink from it. But then there was a lioness lying there on the other side of the stream and it laughs at him when he gets up. \"What are you laughing at?\" he says. \"I'm laughing at you because you want to be king in Paris. You'll become king too, but it is only going to happen after a lot of crap. Now you're going to go through three forests, and someone is going to come up to you in the first forest and ask you if you don't want him to be your servant, but you are not to take him. Then you'll go into the second forest, and yet another person is going to come to you and offer to be your servant, but you're not to take him either. Finally, you'll go into the third forest and the third one that comes up to you, that's the one you should take as your servant, since he'll be true to you, and that is going to be really important for you. Here is a wallet, it can never be emptied of money, and here is a sword, everything that you show its edge to will fall. And here is a hat, it has three corners as you see, and when you spin it, then two hundred canon salvos come out of each corner. Now when you get to the middle of this last forest you will come to a house, and you are to go in there. There is an old hag who lives there and she will ask you to go down to get a candle that is burning down in the cellar. You're to go down and get it but she'll ask you for it before you come up. You should make sure she doesn't get it because then she'll push you back down into the cellar and then she'll kill you. You're to take it up with you and keep it. There is a large genie down there in the cellar, you can call him to you wherever you are, and as soon as you light that candle, he'll come and ask you your command, and then you can always get from him whatever you desire. But since I've now given you all this information about this, I ask that you remember me when you reach a position of honor and respect.\" Yes, he promised her that and then he traveled on.\n      When he had gone a little way, the first person comes up to him and asks if he'd like to have him as his servant. But he says no to that offer. Then he goes into the second forest, and another one comes up to him. He won't take him as his servant either. Finally in the third forest he meets the third guy and asks him if he'll be his servant. \"Servant! You don't need a servant!\" Well, he really wanted to have him and so he reaches down in his wallet and takes out a handful of money and gives it to him. Well, then he would be willing to be his servant, he saw that he had enough money and then he followed along with him. They come to this little house that the lioness had mentioned, and the soldier went in. The only person there was an old woman, and he said, \"Good evening, Mutter!\" -- \"Good evening, my little son,\" she answers, \"are you here? I've waited so long for you. Would you go down in the cellar and get me that candle that is burning down there?\" Sure, and so he went down there. That giant genie was lying down there. When he'd gotten hold of the candle and was going to come up again, she shouts, \"Oh, give me the candle, son, I'm afraid you'll break it.\" -- \"No, I'll take good care of it,\" he says, and then he came up holding it in his hand, and he showed her the edge of his saber. She immediately fell down dead. Then he traveled on with the candle and his other things.\n     When they got out of the forest they were on the outskirts of Paris. Then he says to his servant, \"Can you bring us to the nicest inn here in all of Paris?\" -- \"Oh, God help us,\" he says, \"we'd better go to one of the more simple ones, the nicest one is far too expensive.\" No, he wanted to go to the very best. Then the servant showed him to one that was right across from the king's castle and they took their lodgings there.\n     In the evening as they were sitting there, the old soldier says, \"What is that music we can hear?\" -- \"Oh, that's the king's daughter, she's playing piano.\" Then he lights the candle, and the genie appears before him. \"What does my master desire?\" -- \"I want you to get me a piano twice as good as the one the princess is playing.\" Oh sure, the genie traveled off and soon returned with it. And so the next evening, the soldier began playing on it, and the princess hears it. Then she comes and wants to buy it from him. No, he didn't want to sell it, but she offered him a lot of money and he finally let her have it. The next evening, he lit the candle again, and the genie comes and asks, \"What does my master desire?\" -- \"I want you to get the princess over here for an hour every night.\" Yes, that would happen, and she came too. The genie went and got her every evening. Now over in the castle they noticed that the princess wasn't sleeping well at night and they also discovered that she was being brought somewhere else. To figure out where she was going, they tied a bag of peas around her neck, and so they were able to find out where she was going. There was a hole in the bag and the peas showed them the way. The king gets so upset when he discovers where she's been going that he had the soldier placed in the tower next to the castle, and placed a round-the-clock guard on him. He sat there and then he asked the guard to call for his servant because he couldn't light his candle and his servant had his lighter. No, says the guard, he didn't dare do that. Then he reaches down into his pocket and takes up a fistful of money and throws it out the slot to him. That helped and he went and got his servant. The soldier asks him to get his flint and when he gets it he lights the candle, and then the genie is standing there in front of him again. \"What does my master command?\" -- \"I command you to build me a tower before dawn twice as big as this one and right beside it here outside of the king's windows.\" Well, things got busy but the next morning when the king woke up and looked outside he had to rub his eyes because he saw the giant tower and couldn't for the life of him figure out where it had come from. He asks around and finally he is informed that the soldier had had it built during the night. Now the king got scared and he didn't dare deny the soldier his daughter any longer.\n     So the soldier marries her. Then he asks her to put his hat and his sword away for safe keeping, and he told her about their special qualities. Then she had ones made that were exact copies and had them ready, and no one could tell them apart. Then it happens that war breaks out, and this prince--since the soldier had now become a prince--he was to go out and fight. But he didn't want any warriors with him, he could do it by himself, he said. When he was going off, he asked his wife to give him his hat and his sword, and she came with the copies she'd had made. Now when he got out to the enemy, he spun his hat and said, \"Fire!\" But no, it wouldn't fire. Then he realized he'd been tricked. He showed them the sword, but it wouldn't do its duty either. \n     The end result was that he was captured, and they built a huge bonfire, he was to be burned on it. As he stood by the bonfire, he asked if he couldn't have a pipe of tobacco before he was to be burned, and they thought it a shame to deny the prince that. He then asked if he couldn't light it with his own flint, and they gave him permission to do so. Then his servant came with it, and then he lit the candle, and then the genie stood there before him again. He said, \"What does my master command?\" -- \"I command you to cut down all of these warriors at the knees!\" He did that and then the prince was free. \n     Now he traveled home to his wife and she said that she was so sorry, she had made such a big mistake and she regretted it deeply. Here were the real ones and she gave them to him. Then he showed her the edge of his saber and she fell down dead, killed because of her unfaithfulness. Now he was back to his worthy position again and he remembered the lioness that had been so good to him and was still lying by the stream waiting. So he traveled off to her, and she became very happy when she saw him and said, \"Will you chop my head off now?\" He didn't want to do that, but she begged and pleaded, and so he did that, and then she turned into a beautiful and much wished for princess. So he married her and they lived the rest of their lives as king and queen in Paris, and had a wonderful life."}, {"story_id": 270, "full_name": "235 - 1.50 - \u00c6v_0_1514", "publication_info": "\u00c6v_0_1514", "annotation": "Kirsten Marie continues with a standard variant of ATU 325, \"The Magician and His Pupil\".\n\n     Holbek points out that these tales, however fanciful, reflect not only psychological tensions between the generations and the sexes, but also the economic tensions that animate day to day life in rural Denmark. \n\n     Large family size was one of the greatest factors that contributed to persistent rural poverty. Since farm plots were generally small, inheritance of the land (when possible and not limited by non-inheritable leaseholds) usually went to the oldest son. In many cases there was no inheritance at all, and the oldest along with the rest of the children were essentially left to fend for themselves.\n\n     Once the children reached confirmation age, they usually left home to work at other farms. Schooling also ended at the same time. The young boy's ploy to get work from the magician echoes the switch Kirsten Marie's father plays on the beggar bailiff in an earlier story (KMP 1.03). Amusingly, the protagonist in this story has to renounce the very education that was intended to allow him to find work and contribute to society in a meaningful fashion.\n\n     Family size and the limited opportunities afforded adult children also contributed to the development of the itinerant class of beggars and merchants who are an important feature of Kirsten Marie's storytelling. The horse peddler is of course another manifestation of that itinerant class.\n\n     Tang Kristensen did not publish this tale in any of his collections.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en G. en Mand h havde s. mange B\u00f8rn\nog s. da den [tol] \u00e6ldste blev noget stor, s.

You can climb up here on back and come with me home. Then he rode home. When they got home he said, here is a room with lots of books, now I need you to keep them clean, don't do anything else. The boy read and read a bit in the books, and they were different kinds of arts, he could turn himself into whatever he wanted. And the man, they called him the black magician. Then he traveled away from the town and said to the boy: Now, take care of the books and keep them clean. There was to be a market and his father really needed money. So he decided to turn himself into a horse and his father could sell him and could get a lot of money for him. He brought him to market too and there was the black magician as well, and he recognized the horse. Then he wanted to buy him from the man. But the boy had forbidden his father, he wasn't to sell him with his halter on, take it off the horse. There were so many who wanted to buy the horse, but the black magician offered so much. He didn't want to sell it with the halter. Finally sell it with the halter, otherwise he didn't want it. He got the horse and led it home. He forbade his people to take the halter off of him. Each day he was let out and was watered, and he scraped and scraped at his nose and wanted to take the halter off. One day a young boy came out there, they had so many children, and he said, oh come on, let's take the halter off of him, he can't drink with the halter on. As soon as it came off, he turned himself into a bird and flew out of the door. Then the magician came out and turned himself into a hawk and went after the bird. Then they came to a princess's window and she saw the little bird that the hawk was chasing and she opened the window and the bird flew in and the hawk had to stay outside. A few days later, a horse dealer came there and then he said to the princess that he would now turn himself into a gold ring and put himself on her finger and the only thing the dealer wanted to buy would be the gold ring, but when you sell it, you have to let it fall on the table first.

When the oldest one had gotten fairly big, he decided he wanted to go out and find a job. As he is walking along, he meets a person who is riding by. \u201cWhat are you out after, little boy?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going out to find a job.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWon\u2019t you work for me?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, I can just as well work for you as for someone else,\u201d says the boy. \u201cCan you read?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, I can. We have a lot of children, but my father made sure on that account, we all had to learn our learning.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, then I can\u2019t use you, I need a boy who can\u2019t read,\u201d and he rode on. But the boy now wanted the job, and so he ran around and turned his clothes inside out, and he ran over so that he met up with the man again. Now the same thing happens again. The man asks if he wants to work for him, and whether he can read. \u201cNo, I certainly cannot,\u201d says the boy. \u201cWell, then I can use you. Now you can get up here on back, and then come along with me.\u201d Then he got up to ride. When they got home, he says: \u201cHere is a room with a lot of books, you are to keep them clean and do nothing else.\u201d The boy went there among the books every day and read them. He learned a lot from them, and there was instruction in how to do magic and turn oneself into whatever one wanted. People called the man that he worked for the Black Magician. The magician often traveled, and then he would say to the boy: \u201cMake sure that you take care of the books and keep then nice and clean.\u201d Now the boy knew that his father needed money, and then he heard that there was to be a market nearby. Now he thought that he\u2019d learned quite a bit, and so he goes home to his father and says: \u201cNow I\u2019m going to turn myself into a horse and you\u2019re to bring that horse to market and sell it, and you can get a lot of money for it. But you have to remember, you are not to sell me with the halter on, you have to remember to take it off and keep it.\u201d The father promised that, and then he took him to the market. The Black Magician was there too, and he recognized the horse and wanted to buy it from the man. There were many others who wanted to buy that horse, since it was so beautiful, but the Black Magician bid the most. The man wouldn\u2019t sell the halter with it, and the magician absolutely wanted to have the halter. Finally, he bid so much that the man didn\u2019t feel he could let him walk away, but if he couldn\u2019t have the halter, then he didn\u2019t want it. Then the boy\u2019s father made a decision, and the Black Magician got the horse and led it home with him. Now the magician forbade his people from taking the halter off. Every day that it was led outside to be watered, it scraped and scraped at its nose and absolutely wanted the halter off. Now the magician had lots of children, and one day one of them came out there and saw that and he said: \u201cOh, let\u2019s take the halter off of him, he can\u2019t really drink with the halter on.\u201d They take it off, but as soon as they\u2019ve done that, the horse turned itself into a bird and flew off. Then the magician comes in the door at that moment and he sees what has happened, and he turns himself into a hawk and flies off after the bird. The bird got close to a princess\u2019s window, and when she sees the little bird and how the hawk was chasing it, she opens her window and the bird flew in, but the hawk had to stay outside. The bird changed itself into a young man and said to the princess that he was now going to turn himself into a gold ring, that she could put on her finger, and a traveling salesman (horse trader) would come who wanted to buy the ring, and she could sell it to him, but she was to let it drop onto the table first. A few days later a traveling salesman came and asked the princess if she wanted to sell the gold ring that she had on her finger. Sure, that would be good, and they agreed on the price. Then she took it off her finger and let it drop down onto the plate. Then he turned himself into a barley corn, and the magician turned himself into a rooster, because it was no other than he who had pretended to be a horse trader. The rooster wanted to take the barley corn, but then the boy turned himself into a fox and bit the head off of the rooster. Then that was the end for the magician, and the boy stayed with the princess and when he got older, he married her, and they lived happily together the rest of their lives."}, {"story_id": 271, "full_name": "235 - 1.51 - DS_VI_2", "publication_info": "DS_VI_2", "annotation": "Kirsten Marie returns to localized legends with this next story.

And that happened too. The oldest son set off and wanted to try his luck. Came to a market town and there was a king there who had a daughter, and they were flying black flags and everyone was so sad. It seems so sad here in the town, what is going on? Well, it was the princess. The king had given her to a dragon that had helped him in a war. Oh, he said. Now it was going to come and get her today. Finished up, got up on his horse, grabs his sword by his side and rides out to her. What are you sitting here for? Couldn't he save her? No, probably not, since the dragon was coming to get her. Wanted to try anyway. The carriage driver's name was the Red Knight, he'd climbed up into a tree, and was scared. And now the dragon came, whistling and roaring, it had three heads. He sat down next to her and she sat and fixed his hair. Who is that sitting in my sweetheart's lap? It was mine before it was yours. Well, let's fight over it. Then the dog and the horse attacked him. Took the tongues, hid them in his pocket. Rode away. She'd bound her gold ring in his hair. Second day, met at the same spot. One with six heads. Same way. Third day. Nine heads. He got rid of all three of them. She promised she'd have him and wait a year for her. Now he wanted to travel for a year and then come back again. The red knight had taken all the heads. He'd saved her, otherwise he'd kill her. Said that. Well, then she was to have him. Asked for a year to mourn, since she'd had that great sorrow. When the year was up, she was to have the Red Knight. Came riding to the same inn. Flags were flying and everything looked so nice. Asked why that was. That was because the princess was to have a big celebration (wedding) today. He sat there with the innkeeper. A piece of the roast. Oh good lord. Tied a note around the dog's neck... roll up a small napkin and they tie the roast in that. Would be fun to have a piece of cake. Well, now he'd see if that was possible. Went off. Good enough with a piece of cake. The Red Knight angry. He didn't want those dog tricks. Yes, well she wanted to say that it was that dog's master who'd saved her. Went up and got him. He was riding down there ... Well, that's a lie... The one who'd been there first had probably taken the tongues out of the heads. The Red Knight was rolled to death in a spiked barrel and the other one got the princess. The first night, he says, what is that light shining out there? An evil old woman, she's probably a witch. Wanted to see her. Oh, no, he really shouldn't. Yes, thought he'd ride out there. Tied up his horse. Went in. Good evening, he said. Thank you, please come in, little son, she said. Oh, I'm so scared of that dog. Won't you take a hair from my head and put in on the dog's nose? Sure. Oh ... horse. Hair, nose. Pulled a clump of hair out of her head, and put it on the horse's nose. Did you do it, little son. Yes. Hair become iron and iron hold tight. Then they were bound in iron chains, both the dog and the horse. She killed him too and tossed him in to all the other dead bodies she had. She had a lot. Now at home they saw that the bottle turned red. Then the other brother left to save his brother. Came to the same inn. As soon as he came in, they began to call him Prince, and he rode down to the castle. She came and greeted him warmly and asked if he'd returned. She was so friendly to him, didn't know that he wasn't her husband. When they were to go to bed, he took his sword and placed it between them. Why did he do that tonight? Yes, well he wanted to use that custom tonight. When they got into bed, he said, what is that light shining out there so clearly? But I told you that last night. Yes, that's right, I didn't remember that, I think I'll go out there again tonight. Wondered if he'd been killed out there. Rode out there. Recognized his brother's horse and dog. Knew that it was there. Went in to the old hag, too. Good evening, little son. Thank you, good evening, Mutter. I'm so scared of your dog. Would you.... He pulled a clump of hair from her head and threw it on the fire. What's crackling? Oh it is lice and shit from her old sow. Would he ... horse. Yes, he did that too... What was it that crackled? Have you done it? Yes. Hair become iron and iron hold tight. But nothing held tight. Go (pus?), he said, and then the horse and dog attacked the hag. You need to bring my brother and his ... back to life, otherwise we'll kill you. Yes, I'll do that little son. And she went in and rooted about among the dead bodies and she found him, had a pot with some salve in it and she smeared it on him and he came back to life. He forced her to release the horse and the dog, and then they killed the hag, and then they brought the salve back home. On the way home, the one said to the other, I lay with your wife last night. Did you lie with my wife last night? And then he became furious and killed him on the road and threw him out into the forest. When they were going to bed, How could it be that you lay your sword between us last night? Oh, that was just something I'd thought up last night. Then he got up and took the pot with him and went out and smeared him back to life. You know, I realize it is a complete lie what I'm sitting here telling. I'd like to have a pot like that too. Then they rode up to the princess, but then she didn't know which one was her husband.

She killed him too and tossed him in to all the other dead bodies she had. She had a lot. Now at home they saw that the bottle turned red. Then the other brother left to save his brother. Came to the same inn. As soon as he came in, they began to call him Prince, and he rode down to the castle. She came and greeted him warmly and asked if he'd returned. She was so friendly to him, didn't know that he wasn't her husband. When they were to go to bed, he took his sword and placed it between them. Why did he do that tonight? Yes, well he wanted to use that custom tonight. When they got into bed, he said, what is that light shining out there so clearly? But I told you that last night. Yes, that's right, I didn't remember that, I think I'll go out there again tonight. Wondered if he'd been killed out there. Rode out there. Recognized his brother's horse and dog. Knew that it was there. Went in to the old hag, too. Good evening, little son. Thank you, good evening, Mutter. I'm so scared of your dog. Would you.... He pulled a clump of hair from her head and threw it on the fire. What's crackling? Oh it is lice and shit from her old sow. Would he ... horse. Yes, he did that too... What was it that crackled? Have you done it? Yes. Hair become iron and iron hold tight. But nothing held tight. Go, he said, and then the horse and dog attacked the hag. You need to bring my brother and his ... back to life, otherwise we'll kill you. Yes, I'll do that little son. And she went in and rooted about among the dead bodies and she found him, had a pot with some salve in it and she smeared it on him and he came back to life. He forced her to release the horse and the dog, and then they killed the hag, and then they brought the salve back home. On the way home, the one said to the other, I lay with your wife last night. Did you lie with my wife last night? And then he became furious and killed him on the road and threw him out into the forest. When they were going to bed, How could it be that you lay your sword between us last night? Oh, that was just something I'd thought up last night. Then he got up and took the pot with him and went out and smeared him back to life. You know, I realize it is a complete lie what I'm sitting here telling. I'd like to have a pot like that too.

The story is similar to the earlier version, and confirms that legend (and personal experience narrative) can be crystallized in performance (Tangherlini 2003; Siikala 1990). Despite the crystallization, there are certain changes: the order of unbound phrases, place names, and word choice have all been slightly altered (Labov and Waletzky 1967). The etiological tag that explains how the church got its name, and how the mound came into being, remains a prominent feature of the story.\n\n     In the previous telling, Kirsten Marie had used the words \"joor\" and \"boor,\" which were normalized to \"jord\" and \"b\u00e5rer\" for \"earth\" and \"fallow fields.\" In this telling, she substitutes the word \"h\u00e5r'e\" (=h\u00e5rde) for \"joor\" and the word \"b\u00e5re\" for \"boor.\" It may well be that Tang Kristensen normalized the spelling while writing, as he does not appear to be concerned with noting dialect or alternate pronunciations in this particular recording.

The legend tells of a cobbler who does not let Jesus lean against his house when he is on his way to Golgatha with the cross. The Jew, in turn, is condemned to wander the earth forever without rest except for one day each year: the night before Christmas (DS II G 88, G 89). Some variants of the story mention a provision for weekly rest (DS II G 87). If a plow was left outside on that night, the wandering Jew might rest on it, with the result that only weeds would grow wherever the plow plowed. This belief links the Wandering Jew to beliefs concerning the mare and its destructive tendencies (PJ 3.04).\n\n     The story of the Wandering Jew first appeared in a pamphlet \"Kurtze Beschreibung und Erz\u00e4hlung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus\" [A Short Description and Story about a Jew named Ahasverus] printed in Leiden in 1602. It is unlikely that Kirsten Marie read the story in the pamphlet, even though the pamphlet was quickly translated into many languages, including Danish, soon after its publication. \n\n     The legend speaks to several important concerns. First, it supports the idea of mercy (and the concomitant strongly Lutheran notion that good deeds in this life are rewarded in the afterlife). The story also indirectly brings up the notion of wandering ethnic outsiders in the Danish landscape and their perceived threat to the economy of the farm. Accordingly, the story aligns well with Kirsten Marie's other stories about vagabonds (natm\u00e6nd, tattere and rakkere). ", "danish_manuscript": "Wassens Skomager var jo Skomager.

The threat of war--and the threat of conscription that rested solely on the peasant class--must have seemed almost constant up through the late 1860s. \n\n     Kirsten Marie makes an interesting distinction between the wars that Denmark was either engaged in or recovering from. Most notable were the Three Years War (Tre\u00e5rskrigen) from 1848 to 1851 (F\u00f8rste Slesvigske krig, First Schleswig war), and the war with Prussia in 1864 (Anden Slesvigske krig, Second Schleswig war). In 1807, Denmark entered into a catastrophic alliance with Napoleon in an attempt to maintain control of the kingdom and the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenborg. England declared war on Denmark in November of that year after they had bombarded Copenhagen and confiscated the Danish Navy in September and October. The end result of Denmark's alliance with Napoleon was the loss of Norway to Swedish rule, and the bankruptcy of the kingdom in 1814. \n\n      The reference to the war of 1807, which appears at the beginning of the published variant, but at the end of the manuscript variant, may either be Tang Kristensen's own annotation, or it may be a response to a direct query from Tang Kristensen.", "danish_manuscript": "I mellem Nielstrup og Rud kirke gik to\nM\u00e6nd en Aften.

The farmhand attempts to bring home the harvest, only to have the witch tip his wagon. Oddly, the witch seems to be deriving no clear personal benefit from this--rather, she is simply destabilizing the cart and, by extension, the local economy (BJK 1.35).\n\n     The farmhand's approach to dealing with the threat is straightforward and somewhat unusual. The threat of a beating brings the witch around. In other legends, a wide range of strategies are endorsed for dealing with witches, from calling cunning folk, the local minister, or the local magistrate, to dealing with them by oneself (Tangherlini 2000). \n\n     Witchcraft trials were no longer common in Denmark in the nineteenth century, and the accusation of witchcraft, although accompanied by local approbation, had little legal weight. It is worth noting that the woman who is described here as a witch is a poor, elderly woman. Accusations of witchcraft, when they were made, were frequently leveled at economically disenfranchised, single women. This status contrasts significantly with that of the cunning folk who, because of their community status, could sidestep such accusations (Tangherlini 2000).\n\n     The name Ma' R\u00f8gters is likely an abbreviation of the name of a person, Maren, who was married to or had been married to, a r\u00f8gter, or stable hand.", "danish_manuscript": "En gl.

There were also debates over the care for pregnant wanderers such as the woman in this story. Many small communities expressed a concern that the care for poor wanderers (foreign poor) and their children would place an undue burden on local farmers (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).\n\n     The apparent wealth of the gypsies, who were clearly neither local nor poor, reflects the growing concern of a free rider problem in poverty assistance programs. The party the gypsies throw is further characterized as an ungodly affair, with dancing and gambling, both seen as vices by more conservative Danish Lutherans. Gambling was frequently mentioned in debates over legislation concerning support for the poor as one of the causes for a poverty that an individual had brought upon themselves. \n\n     Stories such as this no doubt supported the belief that some of the people who passed themselves off as poor were gaming the system.

Although indications in the manuscript suggest that the two stories were told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, there are several factors that argue against this. First, and perhaps most importantly, the stories are extremely localized, and take place in Torsager, a town forty-six kilometers away from Kirsten Marie's residence in Hornslet. Torsager does not figure in any of Kirsten Marie's other stories. When Kirsten Marie mentions places, which she does often, those places tend to be either major market towns, such as \u00c5rhus or Randers, or in the immediate vicinity of Rud and Nielstrup. Second, the index to Danske sagn lists  this story as being told by Teacher N. S\u00f8rensen, Torsager, and the next story as being told by Jakob J\u00f6rgensen from Torsager. There is, however, no mention of Teacher S\u00f8rensen in Minder og Oplevelser. After Tang Kristensen left Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter on this, his penultimate visit to her, he took a train to Torsager (MO IV 5). It is likely that he met L\u00e6rer N. S\u00f8rensen on the train or at the train station, or perhaps at Provst Hansen's house, where he went soon after his arrival in Torsager (MO IV 5). \n\n     The index on the cover of the field diary volume is difficult to read, but it indicates that the stories following those told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter were told by Kristiane Mogensdatter (6424b-6427b) and Elisabeth Poulsen (6427b-6429b).

It is also not surprising that she starts by singing one of the most popular and widely attested ballads in Danish tradition, \"Redselille og Medevold\" (DgF 271; BJK 1.08).\n\n     Most variants of DgF 271 start with Rosenlille either weaving with her mother or dancing. Grundtivg does not comment on dice-playing which appears only in Margrete's variant. Her variant is first included in DgF in Dal and Pi\u00f8's addendum as DgF271\u00f8*.\n\n     Margrete refers to the two protagonists by common variants on the names. In the majority of other variants of this ballad, the woman's name is Redselille, a name that Grundtvig speculates is related to the Slavic name Regitse, used in the Danish Royal family starting in the twelfth century (DgF 5, 242).  Roselille, or a close permutation of that name, without the \"n\", is a common substitution, meaning \"little rose.\" \n\n     The printed version adds a second strophe in verse 16, as well as verses 17 and 18. Verse 18 in the printed version appears as a variant form of verse 10. The printed version also includes verse 19, even though it appears at the very end of the ballad in the manuscript, set apart as a refrain. The main refrain is a bit unusual, as it is simply stylized laughing, a striking counterpoint to the otherwise tragic story of the ballad. It is unclear when (or even if) the second refrain is actually intended to replace the laughing refrain because Tang Kristensen recorded it at the end of the ballad, and made no annotation as to when it may have been performed.\n\n     After verse 19 in the manuscript, Margrete mentions that the two lovers went off into the woods, and then she sings a verse that more likely belongs in her next ballad. Accordingly, Kristensen bracketed it, and then included it in the printed version of the next ballad, altering the name from \"R. Allerkj.\" (abbreviated form of my beloved Rosenlille) to \"stolten Gulenborg\", the female protagonist of that ballad.\n\n     Although the ballad is listed in the table of contents of JFm XI as ballad 46, it appears as 45 in the actual published collection. This problem with the numbering is due to the double numbering of \"Hr. Esben og Sidselill\" and \"Tro som Guld\" as ballad 41.\n", "danish_manuscript": "Rosenlille og hendes kj\u00e6r moder de spillede\npaa guldt\u00e6rnen den gode\n--\nog h\u00f8r du Rosenlille kj\u00e6r Datteren min\nder falder ho Blej udi Kinderne din.\nDer maa vel falde Blej udi Kinderne\njeg haver s. meget at Skj\u00e6re og sy .\n--\nHaahaahaahaahaa\nHaver du s. meget at skj\u00e6re og sy\nda ere der vel andre i denne [hendes] vor By\nsom baade kan skj\u00e6r og sy\nOg h\u00f8r du R. kj. datteren min\nder springer jo M\u00e6lk udaf Brysterne din\nDet er ikke M\u00e6lk det synes kun saa\ndet er den brune Mj\u00f8d jeg drak udi Gaar\nMj\u00f8den er brun og M\u00e6lken den er hvid.\nDisse to Ting de ere hverandre ulig\n--\n[A h\u00f8r du] Nu gj\u00f8r det ej gode l\u00e6nge at d\u00f8lge for jer\nved Det l.

Apparently, during performance, Margrete repeated what she had sung earlier (probably by mistake), and Tang Kristensen, rather than record the lines again, simply noted \"osv. Se foran\" [etc. See above]. He also added the lyre, as in the manuscript it is unclear what it was that was gilded (there is no referent for the adjective). In the published version, Tang Kristensen also interpolates the second line of verse two, likely from another variant by another informant as the phrase does not appear in Margrete's repertoire. The wording of the postscript is slightly different in the printed version where the reference to Gulenborg being banished from the land is absent. Tang Kristensen turned the reference to banishment in the postscript into the missing line of verse 2 in the printed version, despite the fact that leaving the country of one's own free will is substantively different than being banished.\n\n     The postscript does not appear in any of the other variants that Tang Kristensen collected, and appears to be an attempt by Margrete to anchor the ballad in the local landscape. Tang Kristensen interprets Klasholm in the manuscript's postscript as the castle \"Klavsholm.\" Klavsholm (or Clausholm) lies midway between Randers and \u00c5rhus in Jutland, and was built by Chancellor Conrad Reventlow in the 1690s. His daughter, Anna Sophie, was kidnapped from Clausholm by the love struck King Frederik IV in 1712, after she had been imprisoned in the castle by her mother. Frederik married her in 1721, after the death of his wife, Queen Louise. He subsequently had Anna Sophie crowned queen. When he died in 1730 at Odense Castle, she was banished to Clausholm, where she lived out her days as a widow, dying in 1743. \n\n     Rosenholm castle was built in the 1670s by Chancellor of the Realm J\u00f8rgen Rosenkrantz, and the castle and its lands are still administered by the same family (18th generation). The family name figures prominently in Shakespeare's Hamlet, along with another Danish noble family name, Gyldenstierne, appearing in Shakespeare's play as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\n     While the ballad may refer in an obscure fashion to the relationship between Anna Sophie and Frederik IV (1671-1730), there is no direct historical connection between their affair and Rosenholm castle or the Rosenkrantz family. More than likely, Margrete connected the ballad to stories she had heard about Frederik IV, Anna Sophie and Clausholm. Once she had narratively sent Gulenborg to Klavsholm, she needed to find an appropriate place to send Hr. Ridebold. Since Rosenholm was the grandest castle she knew, playing as it did a significant role in the economic landscape where she lived, she connected the protagonist of the ballad to it. Klavsholm would have been equally known to her. The connection between the castle and Frederik IV may have resonated with her own alleged connection to the royal court of Frederik VI, the great-grandson of Christian VI, who was the son of Frederik IV by a different mother.", "danish_manuscript": "Hr.

Danish nicknames often include place name referents. The boy has mistaken the mound dweller for a human, a common occurrence in variants of this story (DS I 270). In some variants, the story revolves around the discovery that the seemingly human figure is actually a mound dweller (DS I 266). In this variant, the interaction between the boy and the girl is one between peers as both of them doing chores for their respective employers. \n\n     There are numerous other stories where humans encounter mound dwellers on their way to or from birth celebrations or baking. In this case, the little girl is bringing food to the presumably sick or old Boels-Maren from a feast celebrating the birth of another mound dweller, as \"barselmad\" is glossed by Feilberg as \"the food sent from a birth celebration to sick people in town\" (Feilberg 1910, vol. 1, 52). \"Barselmad\" or birth food can, according to Feilberg, also refer food given to a woman who is pregnant or has just given birth (\"food for a birth celebration or for a woman who has just given birth\"). If one reads the term in this latter manner, then Boels-Maren is possibly a kidnapped human who has just given birth inside the mound. The story succinctly confirms the parallel nature of mound dwellers' society and human society. In other stories of mound dwellers' births, a human is kidnapped by the mound dwellers to assist in the birth (DS I 1098 and 1122 ).", "danish_manuscript": "Der kom en bitte Pige om ved en Tjeneste\ndreng, og s. spurgte h. hende efter hvor\nhun skulde hen.

One also needs to interpolate a missing conversation between the boy and the mound dweller to understand the seemingly obscure reference to Tordenf\u00e5er (Thunder father) and M\u00fctter Maria (mother Mary). In other variants of this legend, the boy has either gone out to ask the mound dweller to stand as godfather for the farmer's child--an interesting reversal of the mound dweller asking a farmer's wife to act as midwife to his wife--or to trick the mound dweller into giving a large monetary gift to celebrate the birth of the child--again, a parallel to the midwife legends (DS I 1414). In other variants of this legend, the mound dweller provides a substantial monetary gift, but begs off attending the celebration because the guests will include religious figures (the mother Mary, and in most cases the Lord and St. Peter), and the music will be drumming (referred to in this case as \"Tordenf\u00e5er\" (Thunder father) by the mound man) (DS I 1413). \n\n     The mound dweller apparently assists the hired hand in his work in this story, and thus takes on some aspects of the helpful nisse.

The conflict between cunning folk and wise ministers appears frequently in Danish legends, and points toward the tension between the secular and the ecclesiastic in late nineteenth century Denmark (DS VII 176).\n\n     In the first account, the emphasis is on the wise minister's ability to counteract the economic threat of theft by revealing the location of a stolen object (showing again) or otherwise revealing the identity of a thief (KMP 1.56, 1.57) . The minister's powers fail when scissors are put to the canvas, reflecting the power of metal and knives to interfere with the supernatural.\n\n     The second legend is widely attested in Danish tradition (DS IV 1120, IV 1121). Kathleen Stokker interprets Norwegian variants of the legend as related to the power of the Lutheran minister and the role of confession in Lutheran practice (Stokker 1989). The story certainly plays on the power of the minister to counteract the intrusion of the otherworldly into the community. One of the minister's emblems of power is his book. In some variants of the legend, the book is specified as the Black Book, in others, the Bible (DS V 700) and parallels the cunning folk's use of the Cyprianus. The black book is often used in conjuring ghosts. \n\n     The hapless farmhand who has little business walking about in the liminal space of the cemetery at night is treated as a ghost, even after he reveals himself to be human. He is summarily conjured into the ground and his death. The conflation of Satan and ghosts reflects the Lutheran theological accommodation to the widespread popular belief in ghosts (Tangherlini 1999). The minister's seeming powerlessness to stop the conjuring reveals a chink in his armor: either he is powerless in the face of these greater forces or he proffers a punishment out of all proportion to the farmhand's offense. In either case, the implications are not reassuring. \n\n     The final story also explores the power of the minister, here to reanimate the dead. Blame for the man's suicide is attributed to the wife and the story can thus be read as a negative commentary on marriage. Up through the nineteenth century, people were laid out on straw after death until burial two to three days later. The minister's correspondence with Copenhagen reveals the role of central authorities in local affairs, a matter of great political debate in the last decades of the nineteenth century (N\u00f8rr 1994).", "danish_manuscript": "Pastor Katrup i Skj\u00f8dstrup kunde vise igjen\nH. spurgte hans Kone om hans L\u00e6rred var\nikke henne.

And the husband came in and she asked if he wanted something for dinner and he said he wanted roast chicken. Could not go out to the hen house tonight. That was strange. Well, he wanted that, and so he went out to the hen house. When he opened the door, the minister came running out, but the husband didn't know who it was. Came in and said he had no idea what kind of spectacle there was out there in the hen house, but he couldn't get any hens. The third Sunday, the wife goes once more to church. That's quite a frightened husband you have, says the minster. Yes, he's always like that, you can't count on him. But now next Saturday, he is definitely going to be gone, so we can talk about everything then. Minister again. Were done and had food and drink, went to bed. Took all their clothes off and were about to go to bed and the husband came driving home again. Had no idea what to do. But there was a big feather barrel sitting right there, and she put the lid on a bit. When the husband came in. So, how are you, have you gotten those feathers together. I need to go off again tomorrow, out with the two feather barrels and have them nailed shut tonight. He came in and nailed the barrels shut and had them brought out onto the dung heap since they had to be ready to be loaded up the next day. So he loaded them like that so that he could just get to the church, because he knew quite well what was in the barrel, he and his wife had talked about it with each other. Came right to the church and people were there. Knocked the barrel off and it broke open. And the church folk got scared, they thought that it was the devil who came out of the barrel. But the minister hurried up and went in and got into other clothes and came and held his sermon. The next Sunday, the husband wanted to go to church too, hadn't been there for quite a while, wanted to go in the minister's clothes, they were lying out there. The minister quite recognized the husband. He had no idea how he was going to get away with it, was probably going to say something about it in the sermon, how it had come about. He mentioned that he had gone to a place where they had undressed him and kept his clothes, but now he hoped that it was a gift to both the husband and wife, that they could be more in agreement. He could see that they accompanied each other to church. Since then the wife could go to see the minister and, since then, the man accompanied his wife to church."}, {"story_id": 331, "full_name": "90 - 1.08 - \u00c6v_0_1462", "publication_info": "\u00c6v_0_1462", "annotation": "Economic concerns play a significant role in this active masculine fairy tale since payment for the apprenticeships and the boy's prowess with his crafts are all foregrounded. Unlike many other variants of ATU 517, \"The Boy Who Understands the Language of Birds\", the boy protagonist seems to foster no ill-will towards his parents.\n\n     Holbek suggests that figures such as the princess should be read more as the daughter of a wealthy farmer than an actual princess, and the daughter here seems to confirm that. The boy's parents are not poor, and additions to the story in the fair copy emphasize that. One cannot help but notice the arrangements that the boy makes for his parents, bringing them to the castle rather than leaving them in their advancing years to fend for themselves. Such an arrangement would have had great appeal to a pensioner like Margrete. The parents' donation of their possessions to the poor is an unusually progressive position for a fairy tale, and should be read in the context of the ongoing debate over the care of the poor in rural communities.\n\n     Although the fair copy is not missing from the collection at the Danish folklore archives, the story has never been published.

Thought he was tired of staying home all the time and said that he wanted to start an apprenticeship. Which craft? Well, cobbling. Good to get some shoes. Drove over there and give 400 daler to teach him that and to be good to him. Became quite good at it. Then the cobbler said to him, he couldn't teach him any more, best that he wrote to his parents that they should come and get him. He should write instead that he was a fool and couldn't learn anything and didn't want to anymore anyway. Then the cobbler had to write that, and then they came and got him. They doubted it since he had no desire to stay at home the whole time. Got home. It doesn't matter, you're welcome to stay at home with us, we've got plenty of things for you to do. Stayed at home for a little while, asks if he can't start learning another craft (start another apprenticeship). Sure, which craft. Said goldsmith because that was clean work. Thought that was a very good idea. Brought him to a goldsmith and asked how much he wanted. 400 Daler. Teach him well, had one apprenticeship before, but didn't want to do it. Yes, would do his best. Was there for a while and now was more skilled than the Master. Ready to do things that the Master couldn't. Better write home .... No, not like that, rather that he didn't have any desire etc. Home and was there a while. Start one more apprenticeship. ... Off to learn the speech of birds. Thought that was strange, but off they went. Came to the man who could speak to the birds, and he got 400 daler for that. Clever and could every language and understand every bird. Wanted to write home that he was so clever. Yes, he may, then they'd have the pleasure of that. Was home for a while. The next day a bird comes and sings. What did it say, said his mother. It's singing that I am going to go traveling soon. What are you going to travel for? I don't know, it's singing about that now. Then another bird came and sang. He was going to go out traveling because there was so much good waiting for him. The mother didn't like this very much. A third bird came. What is that one singing? It's singing that I will come home looking so fine that you won't recognize me, and that you will take your silver platter and let me wash myself in it. That will never happen, I would never let you wash yourself in my silver platter. Well, I am going to go now, because that's what the birds are singing about. Went off and first to a cobbler nearby, who worked for the people at the castle. A request for the cobbler came from the Princess asking if they could sew (make) her a shoe identical to the one she had, she'd tossed one of her shoes away. The cobbler thought he couldn't sew (make) such a fine one. But he'd gotten a new journeyman, it could be that he could make one that nice. Came home to the journeyman. Said he'd often done such fine work. It would be finished the next day. And so it was a deal. The cobbler went and looked in at the door. Didn't think he was doing anything. The next day it was finished. Down to the princess. Could she perhaps see this journeyman. She wanted him. He didn't want to yet, he had also learned to be a goldsmith. Wanted to go to a goldsmith. Same kind of message came about a gold ring, make the finest one they could. Was afraid that he couldn't make one as shiny. But had a journeyman. Ask him about that. Sure, could certainly make the ring and everything else. The goldsmith looks in at the door but didn't think he was doing much with it. The next morning. Yes, it has been done for quite a while. Goes along to the princess. The shiniest ring she had ever had, would the journeyman please come. Down there. Talked. Don't you want me. Yes, because she really wanted to and they called the king to them. They could certainly have each other and then have the kingdom. So they got each other. Want to come home and meet my parents. Hitched up (the horses) and started driving. When they got there, the mother and father were sitting inside. Jesus Christ, what kind of fine strangers have arrived? What should we do with them? The rooms are not so nice. Oh, the rooms are good enough, said the husband, let them come in. Would they like something to eat. Sure. Could they stay the night. Oh my goodness, we only have a guest room. Would they be happy to stay there. Very pleased, would love to stay more than anything. Got up early and went and looked to see if they were going to get up anytime soon. Into their clothes, put some water in their silver platter. In to eat. Listen you two old people, don't you have any children. Oh, dear god, we have a single son, had many apprenticeships and traveled off. Can you recognize him. Yes, he has a birthmark on his left arm, a red spot, if I see it, then I'll recognize him. Unbuttoned and showed her the mark. Oh dear god, is this my son. Can you see now, that you've taken the platter that the birds sang about and I've had a fortunate journey. They talked about going with them. Yes, what should we do with the things we have. You can give them to the poor. Yes, we'll do that for our son. They also learned that he was quite good at all his crafts.", "danish_publication": "Der var to gamle Folk, og de havde kun en S\u00f8n. Nu tykte han, at han var kjed af at gaa hjemme hele Tiden, og saa forlangte han at komme i L\u00e6re. \u201dHvad L\u00e6re kan du da have Lyst til at komme i?\u201d siger Faderen. Ja, han vilde da helst v\u00e6re Skomager, for det var da godt at faa noget godt Skot\u00f8j. De gamle var velstaaende Folk, og de kj\u00f8rer saa hen til en Skomager og akkorderer med ham om at tage S\u00f8nnen i L\u00e6re. De skulde give ham 400 Daler for det, og saa skulde han v\u00e6re god ved ham. Han kommer saa i L\u00e6re, det gj\u00f8r S\u00f8nnen, og han blev en meget dygtig Skomager. Saa siger Skomageren til ham: \u201dNu kan a ikke l\u00e6re dig mere, nu er det bedst, a skriver hjem til dine For\u00e6ldre, de kan komme og hente dig.\u201d \u2013 \u201dNej, du skal skrive, a er et Doggerhoved, der ikke kan l\u00e6re noget, og a har heller ingen Lyst til l\u00e6ngere.\u201d Skomageren maatte saa ogsaa skrive det, og For\u00e6ldrene maatte hen og hente ham. Ja, de tvivlede jo godt paa at han ingen Lyst havde til det, for han havde jo gaaet hjemme hele Tiden. Saa kommer S\u00f8nnen altsaa hjem igjen. \u201dDet gj\u00f8r jo ikke noget,\u201d sagde de, \u201dat du ikke blev Skomager, for du kan jo gj\u00e6rne blive ved at gaa hjemme ved os, vi har jo nok at gj\u00f8re imod dig med.\u201d Da han havde saa gaaet hjemme en bitte Tid, saa sp\u00f8rger han, om han maa ikke komme i \u00e9n L\u00e6re til. \u201dJa, hvad L\u00e6re vil du saa i?\u201d\u2014\u201dI Guldsmedl\u00e6re,\u201d siger han, \u201dfor det er da et rent Arbejde, og det tykker a rigtig godt om.\u201d Ja, For\u00e6ldrene havde heller ikke noget imod det, og saa tager de hen til en Guldsmed og sp\u00f8rger om, hvad han vilde have at l\u00e6re deres S\u00f8n Professionen. Ja, han vilde have 400 Daler. \u201dSaa skal du ogsaa l\u00e6re ham godt, han har v\u00e6ret i \u00e9n L\u00e6re f\u00f8r, men den havde han ikke Lyst til.\u201d Det lovede han, og saa vilde de ogsaa godt give de Penge. Han kommer saa til Guldsmeden og er der et Stykke Tid, og han l\u00e6rte saa godt, at han nu var bleven villere end Mesteren, og var rede til at gj\u00f8re det, som Mesteren ikke kunde. Saa siger Guldsmeden: \u201dNu maa a hellere skrive hjem til dine For\u00e6ldre, at de kan komme og hente dig, for nu er du udl\u00e6rt.\u201d\u2014\u201dNej, saadan skal du ikke skrive, du skal skrive, te a har ingen Lyst til at v\u00e6re Guldsmed, og a er et Doggerhoved, der ikke kan l\u00e6re noget.\u201d Ja, det tykte han jo ikke, men det blev til sidst saadan, at Karlen fik ham til at skrive saadan. For\u00e6ldrene kom saa efter ham, og de sagde: \u201dJa, vi t\u00e6nkte det nok, han har v\u00e6ret i \u00e9n L\u00e6re f\u00f8r, og det kunde ikke blive til noget. Men han kan ogsaa godt blive ved at gaa hjemme ved os, for vi har jo nok.\u201d Han kom saa hjem og gik der en Tid. Saa siger han: \u201dA troer, a vil ud i en L\u00e6re til, nu har a faaet Lyst til at komme hen og l\u00e6re Fuglesproget.\u201d De tykte jo, det var s\u00e6rt, men han var vant til at faa hans Vilje, og han skulde af Sted. Saa tager Faderen med ham hen til den Mand, der kunde Fuglesproget, og han akkorderer med ham om at l\u00e6re S\u00f8nnen og skulde have 400 Daler for det. \u201dMen saa kommer du ogsaa til at l\u00e6re ham godt, for nu har han v\u00e6ret i L\u00e6re to Gange, og det er ikke bleven til noget.\u201d Ja, det skulde han nok, og S\u00f8nnen kommer i L\u00e6re og bliver dygtig til Sproget, saa han kunde nu forstaa hver Fugl. Da han har v\u00e6ret der en Tid, saa siger Mesteren: \u201dJa, nu vil a skrive hjem til dine For\u00e6ldre, te nu er du dygtig nok, og nu kan de komme og hente dig.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det maa du godt,\u201d siger Karlen, \u201dsaa faar de da den Forn\u00f8jelse.\u201d Han kommer saa hjem igjen, og da han har v\u00e6ret hjemme en lille Tid, saa kommer der en Dag en Fugl og sidder og synger. \u201dHvad er det, den synger?\u201d siger Konen. \u201dDen synger, te a skal snart til at ud og rejse.\u201d \u2013 \u201dHvad skal du ud at rejse efter?\u201d \u201dJa, det v\u00e9d a ikke, den synger nu saadan.\u201d Saa kom der en anden Fugl, og den sang ogsaa, han skulde ud at rejse, for der var saa meget godt i Vente for ham. Dether tykte Moderen ikke om. Saa kom der en tredje Fugl og sang. \u201dHvad er det saa, den synger?\u201d siger Moderen. \u201dDen synger, te a skal komme hjem i saadan en Finhed, saa I kan ikke kjende mig, og I skal tage jert S\u00f8lvfad og lade mig vaske mig i.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDet skal nu aldrig ske, te a skal tage mit S\u00f8lvfad og lade dig vaske dig i,\u201d siger Moderen. \u201dJa, nu skal a til at afsted,\u201d siger S\u00f8nnen, \u201dfor det synger Fuglene jo hele Tiden om,\u201d og saa gav han sig ogsaa paa Rejsen. F\u00f8rst kom han til en Skomager, der boede t\u00e6t ved Slottet og arbejdede for de Kongelige. I det samme kommer der Bud fra Prinsessen, at hun havde kastet hendes ene Sko hen, og nu vilde hun have Skomageren til at sy Magen til den. Men han tykte ikke, han kunde sy saa p\u00e6n en \u00e9n, for han var jo oppe paa Slottet at se den. Men saa kommer han lige i Tanker om, han havde faaet en ny Svend, det kunde v\u00e6re, han kunde v\u00e6re nok saa dygtig. Han gaar saa hjem til Svenden og snakker med ham om det. \u201dJa, den kan a sagt sy,\u201d siger han, \u201dsaa fint Arbejde har a lavet saa tit.\u201d Ja, den skulde v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdig til Andendagen. \u201dDet kan den sagt blive,\u201d siger han. Han kommer saa paa V\u00e6rkstedet og skal til at sy denher Sko, og Skomageren gik og kikkede ind ad D\u00f8ren af og til, han tykte ikke, han bestilte noget. Men anden Morgen var den f\u00e6rdig, og Skomageren gaar saa ned paa Slottet til Prinsessen med den. Da hun ser den, siger hun, om hun maatte ikke faa den Svend at se. Skomageren gaar saa hjem og siger, at Prinsessen vilde tale med ham. Han kommer ogsaa derned, og da hun ser ham, saa vil hun have ham. Men det havde han ikke Lyst til endnu. Han vilde nu hen til en Guldsmed, for han havde ogsaa l\u00e6rt den Profession. Saa kommer der lige saadan Bud til den Guldsmed fra Prinsessen, om han vilde lave hende en Guldfingerring, og den skulde laves det p\u00e6neste, han kunde. Der blev jo sendt Bud efter ham, men han sagde, at han var r\u00e6d for, han kunde ikke lave \u00e9n saa brilliant, som hun \u00f8nskede den. Men han havde lige faaet en ny Svend, og han vilde sp\u00f8rge ham om det, om han kunde ikke lave den, for han var kanske nok saa dygtig. Han kommer saa hjem og taler til ham om det. \u201dJo, den kan a sagtens lave,\u201d siger han, \u201da kan lave baade Ringe og alting.\u201d Den skulde v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdig Andendagen, og nu skal han til at smede paa den. Guldsmeden gaar jo og kikker til det ind ad D\u00f8ren, men han tykte ikke ret, han gjorde noget ved det. Saa anden Dags Morgen kommer han jo derind og sp\u00f8rger til det. \u201dJa, den har v\u00e6ret f\u00e6rdig l\u00e6nge,\u201d siger Svenden, og saa gaar Guldsmeden ned til Prinsessen med den. Det var den brillianteste Ring, hun havde haft nogen Tider, om den Svend vilde ikke komme ned til hende, hun havde Lyst til at se ham. Jo, Guldsmeden gaar hjem or forretter det, og Svenden rejser ogsaa ned paa Slottet. Da Prinsessen saa ham, saa siger hun: \u201dMen vil du da ikke have mig?\u201d Jo, siger han, dersom hun vilde saa gj\u00e6rne, saa vilde han nok f\u00f8je hende i det nu. De kalder saa Kongen ind til ham og snakker med ham om det, og da han har faaet Redelighed paa, hvordan det har sig, saa giver han ogsaa Lov til, at de maa faa hinanden, og saa skulde han ogsaa have Riget. Der bliver saa holdt Bryllup, og det var nu altsammen saa meget godt. Da de nu havde v\u00e6ret samme i nogle Aar, saa siger han en Dag til hende, om hun havde ikke Lyst til at f\u00f8lge med ham hjem og se til hans For\u00e6ldre. Jo, hun siger jo. \u201dJa, de har det godt, og de har nok at leve af.\u201d Der bliver saa sp\u00e6ndt for, og de kommer til Kj\u00f8ren. Da Vognen kommer saa ind i Gaarden, da sad Mand og Kone inde, og de siger: \u201dJ\u00f8sse Kors, hvad er det for fine fremmede her kommer! Hvad skal vi gj\u00f8re ved dem?\u201d siger Konen, \u201dvi har ikke sa fine Stuer, vi kan vise dem ind i.\u201d \u2013 \u201dAa, Stuerne er gode nok,\u201d siger Manden, \u201dlad dem kuns komme ind.\u201d Han gaar saa ud og faar dem hjulpen af Vognen og faar dem b\u00f8jen ind. Saa sp\u00f8rger han jo, om de vilde ikke have noget at leve af. Jo, det vilde de godt; om de kunde blive der i Nat? \u201dAa, Gud bedre det,\u201d siger Konen, \u201dvi har ikke andet en et Gj\u00e6stekammer,\u201d om de var forn\u00f8jede med at ligge der.

One day he thought that he was tired of staying at home all the time and so he asked to be put into an apprenticeship. \u201cWhat type of apprenticeship would you like to be put into?\u201d said his father. Well, he\u2019d most like to be a cobbler, because it would be good to get some shoes. The old couple were well off, and so they drive him off to a cobbler and reach an agreement with him to take the son as an apprentice. They were to give the cobbler four hundred daler for that and then he was to be good to their son. He starts the apprenticeship, the son does, and he became a very talented cobbler. Then the cobbler says to him, \u201cI can\u2019t teach you anything more now, and so now it is best that I write to your parents that they can come and get you.\u201d \u201cNo, you should write that I\u2019m a fool who can\u2019t learn a thing and that I\u2019m no longer interested either.\u201d The cobbler had to write that, too, and the parents had to come and get him. Well, they doubted quite a bit. He\u2019d had no interest in being at home the whole time he\u2019d been at home. Then the son comes home again. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the fact that you didn\u2019t become a cobbler,\u201d they said, \u201cbecause you can stay here with us at home for a while, we have plenty for you to do.\u201d After he\u2019d been at home for a little while, then he asks if he can\u2019t start another apprenticeship. \u201cSure, what type of apprenticeship would you like now?\u201d \u201cA goldsmith apprenticeship,\u201d he says, \u201csince that\u2019s clean work and I really would like that.\u201d Sure, the parents had nothing against that either and so they take him to a goldsmith and ask him what he wants to teach their son the profession. Well, he wanted four hundred daler. \"Well, then you have to teach him well, he had one apprenticeship before, but he wasn\u2019t interested in it.\u201d He promised and then they were happy to give him the money. The son comes to the goldsmith and is there for a while, and he learned so well that he had now become better than the master and was able to do things that the master couldn\u2019t. Then the goldsmith says, \u201cNow I\u2019d better write home to your parents that they can come and get you, because now you\u2019ve been fully taught.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t write that, you should write that I don\u2019t have any desire to be a goldsmith, and that I\u2019m a fool who can\u2019t learn anything.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not what he thought, but in the end the boy got him to write that. The parents came for him and they said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we expected, he\u2019s been at home with us the whole time, and he\u2019s had an apprenticeship before, and that didn\u2019t lead to anything. But he can stay at home with us, since we have enough.\u201d He came home and stayed there a while. Then he says, \u201cI think I want to have another apprenticeship, now I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d like to go and learn the speech of birds.\u201d They thought that was strange, but the son was used to getting his way, and he wanted to head off. Then his father goes along with him to the man who knew the speech of birds, and arranges with him to teach his son, and he was to get four hundred daler for that. \"But then you\u2019d better teach him well, because now he\u2019s been an apprentice twice, and that hasn\u2019t led to anything.\u201d Yes, he\u2019d certainly do that, and the son begins the apprenticeship and becomes so good at the language that he could understand every bird. After he\u2019d been there a while, the master says, \u201cWell now I\u2019m going to write home to your parents, because you\u2019re good enough now that they can come and get you.\u201d \u201cYes, you can certainly do that,\u201d says the boy, \u201cthen you\u2019ll have that pleasure.\u201d He comes home again and after he\u2019s been at home for a little while, a bird comes one day and sits and sings. \u201cWhat is it singing?\u201d says the mother. \u201cIt's singing that I am going to go out traveling soon.\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat are you going to go out traveling for?\u201d \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know, it's just singing that.\u201d Then another bird came, and it sang too, he was to go out traveling, because there was so much good waiting for him. The mother didn\u2019t like this. Then a third bird came and sang. \u201cWhat is it singing?\u201d asks the mother. \u201cIt is singing that I am going to come home so fine that you won\u2019t recognize me and that you\u2019ll take out the silver platter and let me wash myself in it.\u201d \u2013 \u201cThat will never happen, that I\u2019ll take my silver platter and let you wash yourself in it,\u201d says the mother. \u201cOK, but now I\u2019m going to go,\u201d says the son, \u201cbecause the bird keeps singing about that,\u201d and then he set off on his journey. First he came to a cobbler who lived close to the castle and worked for the royals. Just then, a message comes from the princess, that she\u2019d lost one of her shoes and now she wanted the cobbler to make her one just like it. But the cobbler didn\u2019t think that he could sew such a beautiful one because he\u2019d gone up to the castle to look at it. But then he remembered that he\u2019d just gotten a new journeyman and it could be that he was talented enough to do it. He goes home to the journeyman and talks with him about it. \u201cSure, I can sew that,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve often done such fine work.\u201d  Well it was to be done by the next day. \u201cIt certainly can be done by then,\u201d he says. He goes out to the workshop and is to sew this here shoe, and the cobbler went and looked in on him through the door now and then, he didn\u2019t think he was doing anything. But the next morning it was done and the cobbler goes down to the castle to the princess with it. When she sees it, she asks if she can\u2019t see the journeyman. The cobbler goes home and says that the princess wants to talk with him. He goes down there and when she sees him, she wants to have him. But he wasn\u2019t interested in that yet. He wants to go to a goldsmith because he\u2019d also learned that profession. Then another message comes to the goldsmith from the princess asking if he\u2019d make her a gold finger ring, and it was to be the most beautiful one that he could make. A messenger was sent for him, but the goldsmith said that he was afraid that he couldn\u2019t make one as shiny as she wished. But he\u2019d just gotten a journeyman and he\u2019d ask him about that, if he could make it, because he was apparently quite talented. He comes home and talks to him about it. \u201cSure, I can certainly make that,\u201d he says, \u201cI can make rings and everything.\u201d It was to be done by the next day, and now he was going to start smithing it. The goldsmith goes and looks in on him through the door, but he didn\u2019t really think that he was doing anything. Then the next morning he goes in there and asks about it. \u201cYes, it's been done for a while,\u201d says the journeyman, and then the goldsmith goes down to the princess with it. It was the shiniest ring she\u2019d ever had, would the journeyman come down to her, she wanted to see him. Sure, the goldsmith goes home and arranges it, and the journeyman goes down to the castle. When the princess sees him, she says: \u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d Sure, he says, because she really wants to, he\u2019d agree now. Then the king calls him in to him and he talks to him about it, and when he has been reassured about how things stand, then he gives his permission, and they can have each other and then he was to get the kingdom as well. They hold a wedding and that was all quite nice. After the two had been together for several years, he asks her one day if she would like to follow him home and visit his parents. Sure, she says yes. \u201cYes, they\u2019re fine and they have plenty to live off.\u201d The horses are hitched up and they drive off. When the wagon comes into the farmyard, the mother and father were sitting inside and they say, \u201cJesus Christ, what kind of fine strangers have arrived! What are we going to do with them?\u201d says the mother, \u201cwe don\u2019t have fine rooms to which we can show them.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh, the rooms are good enough,\u201d says the father, \u201cjust let them come in.\u201d He goes out and helps them out of the wagon and gets them inside. Then he asks them if they\u2019d like something to eat. Yes, they would; could they stay there that night? \u201cOh good Lord,\u201d says the mother, \u201cwe only have one guest room,\u201d would they be OK staying there? Sure, they\u2019d be delighted, they\u2019d be more than happy. The mother got up early the next morning and she went and looked to see if they were going to get up soon. Finally they get dressed and she comes with some water in her silver platter, they were to have that to wash themselves in. Then they were to come in and eat. Then the prince says, \u201cListen, you two old people, don\u2019t you have any children?\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh, dear God,\u201d they say, \u201cwe had a single son, but he has journeyed off from us, we had him in many apprenticeships, and it didn\u2019t help any.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWould you recognize him?\u201d says the prince. \u201cYes,\u201d says his mother, \u201che has a mark on his left arm, it is a red spot and when I see it, then I will recognize him.\u201d He unbuttoned his shirt and showed her the mark. \u201cOh, dear God, is this my son?!\u201d \u2013 \u201cCan you see now,\u201d he says again, \u201cthat you\u2019ve taken the platter and let me wash myself in it, just as the birds sang, and you said that it would never happen. I\u2019ve had a wonderful journey and married the princess.\u201d Then the two talk with them, and asked if they didn\u2019t want to come home with them. \u201cWell, what would we do with what we have?\u201d says the father. \u201cYou can share it amongst the poor,\u201d says the son. \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll gladly go and be with our son,\u201d says the mother, and then it was arranged like that, and they followed them to the castle and stayed there for the future. And then they discovered that he\u2019d learned his crafts thoroughly."}, {"story_id": 332, "full_name": "90 - 1.09 - JAT_VI_1040", "publication_info": "JAT_VI_1040", "annotation": "Margrete's proverbial interlude here underscores the importance that she ascribes to shelter.

In ATU 564, the return of the magic object is compelled by the use of another magic object. In ATU 595a, the story ends with the rescue of a princess from a giant, while in ATU 332, the helpful genie does not appear. \n\n      Margrete's reference to a named and presumably historically verifiable figure departs from the expected anonymity of most folk tales. The tale does not fit the model that Holbek proposed for the fairy tale since, unlike most wonder tales, the story does not end in a wedding (the male and female protagonists are already married). It is also difficult to characterize any of the conflicts splitting across Holbek's high status / low status divide. Potentially, one can read the antagonistic neighbor as a representative of the high status group, although there are no narrative clues supporting such an interpretation. \n\n     The collaboration between the husband and wife is presented as a positive force in the tale. The wife's early reasoning about keeping a roof over their heads parallels Margrete's short saying at the end of her first session. Neighbors are represented as a clear economic threat to the well-being of the farm. The implication of the story is that bargaining with supernatural beings, as well as with neighbors, can be dangerous. In bargains with the supernatural, one cannot immediately assess the value of the proffered payment. This type of transaction stands as an extreme example of the barter transactions that were ubiquitous in the rural economies of the late nineteenth century (Tangherlini 1998).  The subsequent bargain struck with the neighbor brings the supernatural bargain into the realm of the everyday. That S\u00f8ren Jensen agrees to trade his cow for a bottle on the way to market is worth noting, as any kind of trading on the way to or from a market was explicitly forbidden by law (Tangherlini 2012). Indeed, it may be S\u00f8ren's willingness to break the law that allows the supernatural to come into the everyday world, and results in the extraordinary nature of the bargains.\n\n    As with most of Margrete's folk tales, this one was never published.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand og Kone, sad ved en bitte\nN\u00e6ring og kunde ikke vel begaa dem.

One day a neighborhood man came over to talk about it. Told about the bottle for the cow. Would he sell it. No, figured he'd keep it. Came again the next day. Sneaked it away from him. Then things got so bad for S\u00f8ren Jensen that he had to go and sell his cow again. As he is pulling it to market, the same person came to him again. It wasn't like that. Took the cork out and two evil spirits came out and beat up S. Jensen. Thought it was the wrong bottle. Went up and traded it with his neighbor. Had gotten a new one that was much better. Traded. Two beat him up. Really angry at S.J. and he got beaten both by the neighbor and another and there was such an uproar it was dangerous.", "danish_publication": "Der var en Mand og en Kone, de sad ved en bitte N\u00e6ring og kunde ikke vel begaa dem. Saa L\u00e6nge Konen havde noget L\u00e6rred at s\u00e6lge, saa flyede hun Manden et Stykke efter et andet, for at han kunde faa en Skilling til at faa Udgifterne d\u00e6kket, men til sidst var det forbi med det, og saa gik det dem til sidst saa n\u00e6r, at de havde ikke uden deres Ko at gj\u00f8re i Penge. Saa siger Manden om han skulde ikke tr\u00e6kke til Marked og s\u00e6lge den. Jo, det tykte Konen nok; der var jo ikke andet at gj\u00f8re, og det var da bedst at blive ved Husv\u00e6rselet saa l\u00e6nge de kunde. Han tr\u00e6kker altsaa med den og paa Vejen kommer han saa til en Mand, der gik i forunderlig Kl\u00e6dedragt. Han gik i en stor lang Kappe, der naaede ham rent ned til H\u00e6lene, og saa var det endda en Sommerdag. De kommer saa i F\u00f8lge med hinanden, og Manden sp\u00f8rger ham, om han skulde til Marked. Ja han skulde, nu var det gaaet ham saa n\u00e6r, at han havde ikke andet end den Ko at s\u00e6lge. \u201dVil du s\u00e6lge den til mig?\u201d siger den fremmede. \u201dJo, det vil a jo nok, hvis du vil give nok for den.\u201d Ja, han havde her en Flaske, og den vilde han give ham for Koen. \u201dEn Flaske!\u201d siger Manden. \u201dJa, den Flaske skal du nok blive forn\u00f8jet med, naar du kommer hjem. Du kan lade din Kone brede en Dug paa Gulvet og saa s\u00e6tte Bordet paa den. Saa kan du tage Tolden af Flasken, og saa kan hun \u00f8nske sig, hvad hun vil, om det saa er Retter fra det kongelige Taffel, saa skal Bordet nok blive d\u00e6kket med det.\u201d Ja, det var jo ikke saa galt, tykte Manden, og saa byttede de, og han gik saa hjem med hans Flaske. Da han nu kommer hjem, saa sp\u00f8rger Maren: \u201dNaa hvad fik du saa for Koen?\u201d \u201dA fik en Flaske!\u201d \u201dEn Flaske!\u201d siger hun helt forundet, og saa fortalte han det hele om den Mand, og hvordan han saa ud. Ja, ham kjendte Konen godt nok, det var \u00e9n af H\u00f8jfolkene. Nu skulde de til at pr\u00f8ve Flasken, og saa skulde de til at \u00f8nske. Manden tykte, han vilde have Gaasesteg, og saa stod den paa Bordet. Han skar saa Hul paa den, og da var Kroppen udstoppet med ene Penge, og de trillede ud paa Gulvet. Nu kan det nok v\u00e6re, de blev glade, nu havde de jo rigelig Erstatning for deres Ko, og havde Penge nok til Udgifterne. \u201dJa, vi kan jo \u00f8nske os nogle flere en anden Gang,\u201d siger Manden, og de satte dem saa til at spise. Da de havde afspist, saa forsvandt det hele igjen i Flasken, og Manden satte Tolden i. Nu begik de sig st\u00e6rkt i mange Aar, og Naboerne kunde ikke forstaa, hvordan de var komne saadan til Kering. En dag gaar \u00e9n af Nabom\u00e6nderne derom og vil snakke med dem om det, han var jo bleven saa nysgjerrig. Endelig maa Manden til at fort\u00e6lle, hvordan han havde handlet med Koen og faaet en Flaske for. Saa sp\u00f8rger Naboen, om han vil ikke s\u00e6lge den Flaske. Nej, det vilde han rigtig nok ikke, den kom han til at beholde. Saa gik Nabomanden med det, men han kom Andendagen igjen og blev ved at snakke om den Flaske, og han vilde da absolut kj\u00f8be den af ham. Saa lister han ham omsider ogsaa til at s\u00e6lge ham den. Man da S\u00f8ren Jensen var af med Flasken, saa var Heldet ogsaa vegen fra ham, og det gik ham til sidst saa n\u00e6r, at han skulde hen og s\u00e6lge hans Ko igjen for at faa Penge til Udgifterne. Idet han nu tr\u00e6kker til Marked, saa kommer den samme Person atter til ham, som han f\u00f8r havde handlet med, og han sp\u00f8rger, om han vil bytte igjen og have en Flaske for hans Ko. Ja, det vilde han godt, og de faar snart den Handel gjort. Han kommer nok saa sj\u00e6leglad hjem med Flasken og fort\u00e6ller hans Kone, hvordan en Handel han nu igjen har gjort. Hun var ogsaa vel tilfreds med det, og de skal til at d\u00e6kke Bord, men da han saa tager Tolden af Flasken, saa kommer der to onde Aander i Land af den, og de begynder at prygle l\u00f8s paa S\u00f8ren Jensen. Det var jo en gal Flaske, han der havde faaet, men saa kommer han i Tanker om, han vil hen og bytte med Naboen, der havde faaet den f\u00f8rste Flaske. Han kommer saa om til ham og siger, \u201dNu har a faaet en ny Flaske og den er meget bedre. Kunde du have Lyst til at bytte med mig?\u201d Ja, han var nok saa begj\u00e6rlg og vilde gj\u00e6rne bytte. De fik Handelen gjort, og S\u00f8ren Jensen rejser af. Men nu skal den anden til at pr\u00f8ve hans ny Flaske, og han faar Tolden af. Da kommer de to Dj\u00e6vle jo og banker l\u00f8s paa ham. Nu blev han jo for Alvor gal paa S\u00f8ren Jensen, og han gaar om og giver ham en Dragt Prygl. Der var ogsaa andre, han fik til at hj\u00e6lpe sig, og nu fik S\u00f8ren Jensen det ikke saa godt.

As long as the wife had some canvas to sell, she would giver her husband one piece after another, so that he could get a shilling to cover their expenses, but finally it was over with that, and finally it got so bad that they didn\u2019t have anything left that they could convert to money but their cow. Then the husband asks if he shouldn\u2019t pull it off to market and sell it. Yes, the wife thought that he should do that; there was nothing else to do and it was best to have a roof over their heads as long as possible. He pulls it along and on the road he meets a man who was walking there in a strange outfit. He was wearing a big long cape that reached all the way to his heels even though it was still summer. They follow along with each other, and the man asks him if he was headed to market. Yes he was, now things had gotten so bad that he had nothing but his cow to sell. \u201cWill you sell it to me?\u201d asks the stranger. \u201cYes, I certainly will, if you\u2019ll give me enough for it.\u201d Well, he had a bottle and he\u2019d give him the bottle for the cow. \u201cA bottle?\u201d says the man. \u201cYes, you\u2019ll be quite pleased with this bottle when you get home. You can let your wife spread a tablecloth on the floor and then set the table on it. Then you can take the stopper from the bottle and then you can wish yourself whatever you want; even if it is dishes from the royal table, the table will be set with that.\u201d That wasn\u2019t so bad, thought the man, and so they traded, and he went home with his bottle. When he gets home, Maren asks: \u201cWell, what did you get for the cow?\u201d \u2013 \u201cI got a bottle!\u201d\u2014\u201cA bottle?\u201d she says, utterly dismayed, and then he told her the whole thing about the man and how he looked. Yes, the wife knew him well, that was one of the mound dwellers. Now they were going to try the bottle, and they were going to wish. The man thought that he wanted roast goose and there it was on the table. He cut into it and the body was stuffed with coins, and they spilled out onto the floor. Now they were happy, now they\u2019d gotten plenty for their cow, and had lots of money for their expenses. \u201cWell, we can wish for more another time,\u201d says the husband, and they sat down to eat. When they were finished eating, it all disappeared back into the bottle and the man put the stopper back in. Now, it went well for them for many years, and the neighbors couldn\u2019t understand how they\u2019d managed such a change. One day one of the neighbor men comes by and wants to talk to them about it, he\u2019d become so curious. Finally, the husband has to tell him how he\u2019d traded the cow and gotten a bottle for it. Then the neighbor asks if he didn\u2019t want to sell the bottle. No, he really didn\u2019t want to, he was going to hold onto it. Then the neighbor went off with that answer, but the next day he came again and continued to talk about the bottle, and he absolutely wanted to buy it from him. Finally he convinces him to sell it to him. But when S\u00f8ren Jensen no longer had the bottle, then all his luck disappeared as well, and finally it went so bad for him that he had to go and sell his cow again to get money for his expenses. As he is heading off to market, the same person whom he\u2019d dealt with comes to him again and he asks if he wants to trade again and get a bottle for his cow. Yes, he certainly did, and they soon seal the deal. He comes home quite happy with the bottle, and tells his wife what kind of deal he has made again. She was also satisfied with it and they went to set the table, but when they take the stopper out of the bottle, two evil spirits come out of it and they begin to beat S\u00f8ren Jensen. It was the wrong bottle he\u2019d gotten there, but then he comes up with the idea that he\u2019ll trade it with the neighbor, who had gotten the first bottle. He comes up to him and says, \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten a new bottle, and it is much better. Would you like to swap with me?\u201d Yes, he was quite eager and would gladly trade. They finished the deal and S\u00f8ren Jensen goes off. But now the other one was going to try his new bottle and he gets the stopper off. Then the two devils come and beat wildly on him. Now he gets really mad at S\u00f8ren Jensen, and goes over and gives him a real beating. There were others, too, that he\u2019d gotten to help him and now S\u00f8ren Jensen wasn\u2019t doing too well.

With both treasures, the solicitous haunt whom the boy confronts instructs him to distribute these ill-gotten gains among the victims or the poor. This distribution of wealth aligns well with other variants of ATU 326a, \"Soul Released from Torment\". \n\n      The story has a great deal in common with legends about guilty, solicitous haunts (Pentika\u00efnen 1969), and less in common with the wonder tales described by Holbek (1987). The innkeeper and the king represent two distinct classes and their \"thefts\" are qualitatively different. In the first case, it is a question of simple theft, whereas in the second case, it is a question of taxation (without representation) being equated to theft. In post-constitution Denmark, significant debate surrounded taxation, and the right of the local versus the national government to tax the local populations. In many ATU 326 variants, the boy finally learns fear from something mundane, such as cold water being thrown on him, or fish being placed in his bed, which is not the case in Margrete's story. In her variant, he is frightened by the overwhelming onslaught of the warrior ghosts.\n\n     This tale was never published.

The farmhand asks her what she could be afraid of in a peat house. Asks if he'd come out with her with the lamp then they'd be able to see it. It turned out there was a hedgehog lying there in the peat. That was nothing to be afraid of. Then he'd heard that there was an inn, he wanted to go there and see if he'd get frightened. He went there and asked to spend the night there. It would be no good to stay there, they had another house to stay in. He really wanted to stay there and see what it was. There was always a bed made up there. He went over and lay down in it. It was a nice warm bed, and just about midnight, someone comes and wants to climb into bed with him. Wow, you're cold, but come on in to me, you can get warm. Then he came to life and it was the old innkeeper, he had buried a lot of money, and he was walking once again because of that and wanted the money to be revealed. He followed with him to the place, it was buried in the cellar in a big pot. He was to take as much as he wanted and the rest were for the people whom he had duped out of their money, then he'd get peace. The next morning, the people came back and he lay there sleeping safe and sound. They called out and asked him how he was. Good. Such and such... the innkeeper had done so many wrongs. But now there was a pot of money. The money was split among the people who'd been duped. After that, no one ever walked again at that inn. Then he went on his way to a castle, he'd heard they couldn't be there either. He wanted to try to get frightened there--he asked if he couldn't stay there. No, my God, no one can stay here. We have to leave every night, there's so much haunting and stuff, we can't stay here, everyone who was here would be killed. Well, there was no danger of that, but he wanted a slave to stay with him. Fine. They were left alone together and they looked around, there was a lot of ham hanging in the chimney. Wanted to cook them some peas. If he'd go get the firewood, he'd go get the water, and light it. Then the slave disappeared. He couldn't understand that. He went out and the slave was lying there with his nose up his ass and he was dead. What are you lying there for? No answer. Took the firewood inside and boiled his peas. Then he goes to bed. Twelve men come in with a coffin and put it down in front of the bed he was lying in and they take the lid off of it. The man gets up and wants to climb into bed with the farmhand as well. It's horrible how cold you are--don't you want to have some peas, it will warm you up. He answers yes. Yes, thank God for that meal, it is has been many years since I had anything to eat. But now I can do as well for you, come with me down to my cellar. There were three pots buried down there and each one was full of money. That's why there was no peace there, he'd taken such huge taxes from the country. The one pot was for the king, the second he could have some of, and the third was to be split among all the people in the country. The next morning the people came, and he was sleeping as if he'd slept the whole night through. Yes he was quite well. Told them why there were disturbances. The old king went again and they got busy with digging up the money. He told the people what the king had said about taxes etc. He still wasn't frightened. Went to another castle, there was quite a commotion there. Sets off and arrives there. Asks if he can stay. No one can stay, there's too much haunting and such commotion, every one who has stayed has been killed. A lot of warriors with weapons came and there's a huge commotion all night long, they were fencing and he lay under the blanket the whole time and didn't dare let himself be seen. He got frightened that time because he didn't discover what it was.

Om Morgenen kom Folkene tilbage, og da laa han og sov trygt. Saa kaldte de paa ham og spurgte, hvordan han havde det. Ja, han havde det godt. Det var gaaet saadan og saadan.

Nu skal du f\u00f8lge med ned i min Kj\u00e6lder.\u201d Karlen rejser sig og f\u00f8lger med ham, og saa ser han tre Kjedeler, som er gravet ned der, og de var fude af Penge alle tre. Han havde v\u00e6ret Konge i Landet og havde taget for store Skatter, derfor kunde han ingen Ro faa i hans Grav. Nu skulde de Penge frem for Dagens Lys igjen. Den ene Kjedel maatte den Konge faa, der nu var i Landet, den anden maatte han tage nogle af, og de \u00f8vrige skulde deles mellem Folkene i Landet. Det lovede han at faa gjort i Orden, og saa gik Kongen i hans Ligkiste igjen, og de 12 Karle kom og bar han v\u00e6k. Om Morgenen kom Folkene tilbage til Slottet, og da sov Karlen trygt, han var jo udvaaget fra om Natten. De kalder saa paa ham og sp\u00f8rger om, hvordan han har det. Ja, han havde det rigtig godt, siger han. Om han saa ikke kunde sige dem, hvorfor der var saadan Uro om Natten?\u201d Jo, det kan a godt, det er den gamle Konge, der gaar igjen, og det er for nogle Penge, han skal have aabenbaret, for han har taget for store Skatter af hans Land. Han viste dem saa, hvor Kjedlerne stod, og sagde, hvordan de skulde deles ud. Nu fik de jo travlt med at faa Pengene i Land og saa faa dem delt ud. Selv fik han nogle, Kongen fik den ene Tredjepart, og det \u00f8vrige blev delt ud til Undersaatterne. Nu havde han skaffet dem Ro der, og saa rejste han derfra, men endnu var han ikke bleven r\u00e6d. Saa kommer han til et andet Slot, og der var en sv\u00e6r Anstalt. Han sp\u00f8rger jo som s\u00e6dvanlig om at blive, og Folkene de siger, at ingen kunde v\u00e6re der, for der gik saa meget Sp\u00f8geri og var saadan Elendighed, for alle var bleven kv\u00e6ld, som havde v\u00e6ret der. \u201dDet kan ikke gj\u00f8re noget om a bliver kv\u00e6kd, lad mig kuns blive.\u201d Han var der saa Natten over, men det var en farlig Tummel. Der kom mange Krigsfolk med Vaaben, og de f\u00e6gtedes inde ved ham. Saa blev han rigtig nok r\u00e6d og laa under Dynen hele Tiden og turde ikke lade sig se. Han fik ingen Redelighed paa, hvad det var, og der blev ingen Ting aabenbaret, saa dem fik han ikke befriet paa det Slot. Men nu havde han rejst saa l\u00e6nge, til han var bleven r\u00e6d.", "english_publication": "A girl had gone out to get peat one evening and then she comes in and says that she had gotten scared. \u201cWhat could  you possibly have gotten scared of out in a peat-house?\u201d says the farmhand. \u201cNothing ever scares me.\u201d Well, if he\u2019d follow her out with the lantern, then they could see what it was. He lights the lantern and they go out there. It was a hedgehog, lying in the peat, and so he teased her a lot. \u201cThat was nothing to be scared of,\u201d he says; \"no, you'd need to find something else if he was going to get scared,\" and he talked big. He had heard that there was an inn where there were ghosts and now he decided that he wanted to go there and asks to stay there. \u201cWell, it won\u2019t do any good for you to stay here tonight,\u201d say the people, \u201cno one can stay here, we have another house to stay in at night.\u201d But he wanted to stay there and see what it was, and he was given permission to do that. There was always supposed to be a bed made up there and he was given permission to lie in it. He settles down when everyone else has left, and when it was up toward twelve o\u2019clock, and he had gotten nice and warm in the bed, someone comes and wants to get into bed with him. \u201cOoh, you\u2019re so cold,\u201d he says, \u201cbut never mind, come in to me, you can warm up.\u201d And so he did that, and now the ghost came to life and told him that he was the old innkeeper there in the inn and he\u2019d buried a lot of money. That was what he was haunting for, since he was supposed to disclose it. The ghost asks the farmhand to follow him to the place where it was buried. It was down in the cellar in a big pot. Then the ghost tells him to take the money he wanted and the rest he was to give to those the ghost had duped, then he hoped to have peace. After that the farmhand slept peacefully until the morning. That morning, the people came back and there he lay and slept soundly. Then they called him and asked how he was. Well, he was fine. Such and such had happened. The innkeeper who\u2019d been there before had done so much injustice and he wanted to disclose the thing with the money, that\u2019s why he haunted. Now there was the pot of money and he brought them down into the cellar and they got it up. Now they were to let everyone know who\u2019d been duped that they could get their money back, and that happened, and since then there was never anyone who haunted in that inn again. Then the farmhand journeyed on, because he wanted to keep traveling until he got scared. He comes to a castle, and he\u2019d heard that the people there couldn\u2019t stay there either, and now he wanted to see if he could get scared there. So he asks if he could stay there at night. \u201cOh, good lord no, no one can stay here at night,\u201d they say, \u201cwe have to leave every night ourselves, there\u2019s so much haunting and bad stuff here. No, we can\u2019t stay here, everyone who stays here gets killed.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s no danger of that,\u201d he says. But he does want a slave to stay with him, and then he\u2019d try to stay there an entire night. Sure, that was fine, and so a slave was brought out who was to stay with him. When they are finally alone with each other, the farmhand started to look around. There was some ham hanging in the chimney and then they were going to boil themselves some peas, since he\u2019d gotten hungry. So he tells this slave to go get some firewood and then some water, and then they\u2019d start a fire. The slave left, too, but he didn\u2019t come back. The farmhand couldn\u2019t figure this out and he goes out to see what has happened to him. Then he discovers the slave lying there dead with his nose bent all the way up his ass. \u201cWhat are you lying there for?\u201d he says, but the slave didn\u2019t answer. So he goes in with the firewood and lights a fire and boils his peas, and after that he goes to bed. Then twelve men come in with a coffin and they put it in front of the bed he was lying in, and they take the cover off. The man who lay there in the coffin, he gets up and wants to get into the bed with the farmhand as well. \u201cIt's rough how cold you are,\u201d he says, \u201cdon\u2019t you want some warm peas to warm you up?\u201d The dead man answers yes to that, and when he has eaten, then he says, \u201cThank God for that dinner, it's been many years since I had that much to eat. But now I can be just as good to you as you\u2019ve been to me. Now follow me down to my cellar.\u201d The farmhand gets up and follows him, and then he sees three pots that have been buried there, and they were full of money, all three. The dead man had been the king of the country and he\u2019d taken too many taxes, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t get any rest in his grave. Now the money should be brought out into broad daylight again. The first pot was to go to the current king in the country, the farmhand could take some money from the second pot, and the rest was to be dealt out amongst the people in the country. He promised to do that, and then the king went back into his coffin again, and the twelve men came and carried him away. The next morning, the people came back to the castle and the farmhand was sleeping so soundly, he was exhausted from the night before. They call to him and ask him now how he was. Well, he was really very well, he says. Could he tell them why there was so much unrest at night? \u201cYes, I certainly can, it's the old king, who is haunting, and it's because of some money he was to disclose because he took too many taxes from his country.\u201d He showed them where the cellar was and told them how the money was to be given out. Now they were busy with the money in the country and got it distributed. He got some himself, the king got a third, and the rest was given out to the subjects. Now he\u2019d gotten them quiet there and he journeyed off, but he still hadn\u2019t gotten scared. Then he comes to another castle and there was a great commotion there. He asks as usual to stay there, and the people say that no one could stay there because there was so much haunting, and such horror, since everyone had been killed who\u2019d stayed there. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I get killed, just let me stay.\u201d He stayed there the night, but there was an incredible tumult there. A lot of warriors came with weapons and they fought in the room where he was staying. Then he got really scared and lay under the covers the whole time and didn\u2019t dare let them see him. He never found out what it was, and nothing was revealed, and so he didn\u2019t free them there at that castle. But now he\u2019d traveled so long that he\u2019d gotten scared."}, {"story_id": 336, "full_name": "90 - 2.04 - DSk_I_13_(23)", "publication_info": "DSk_I_13_(23)", "annotation": "This amusing story relies on aspects of dialect and pronunciation for its comical effect. The story also provides commentary on popular attitudes toward ministers. The minister assumes an overly paternalistic tone toward the seemingly simple Maren, who lets loose with her off-color verse at the very end of an otherwise solemn funeral.\n\n     The manuscript starts out with little dialect notation and then, after a false start, possibly on Tang Kristensen's side, switches to a dialect heavy recording. The obscene reference in the ending verse is covered by the use of an abbreviated dialect word in the published version, py.., an abbreviation for pyk, a dialect term for penis. The entire word is missing in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen having recorded only ellipses, his standard notation for words he considered obscene.\n\n     This story is also cataloged as \u00c6v 1461.", "danish_manuscript": "Per og Maren var et Par \u00c6gtefolk.

Although there is no biographical information about Klemmen in Birgitte R\u00f8rbye's overview of folk healers, his practice is similar to that of many of his cohort described there (1976). \n\n     The theme of distrust and dishonesty among neighbors and friends informs the first of these stories and echoes themes found in many of Margrete's other stories. Rather than supporting an  ideal image of community where one can rely on neighbors for help, these stories paint a darker picture of a society where many people, even close friends, take whatever they can get.     \n\n     Ministers and folk healers were often at odds with each other, as the folk healers represented a clear secular challenge to the authority of the church. Klemmen's ability to fix his tormentor in the mud up to his ankles resonates with stories of ministers who conjure farmhands into the ground (AMJ 1.06).\n\n     The final story about the cursed cows highlights an important difference between witches and cunning folk.

Given the prevalence of mound folk in Margrete's repertoire, it is quite likely that she has conflated the two categories of supernatural beings. The description of the elves presented here is more in line with other descriptions of mound dwellers. In other legends, elves are presented as individualistic, seductive female figures, whose backs appear as hollowed out or rotten tree trunks (DS II A 50; DS II A 59). Elves do not generally appear as collective beings as they do here, a characteristic of the mound folk. Both Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter and Peder Johansen engage in a similar conflation of the categories of elves and mound dwellers (KMP 1.60; PJ 2.03).\n\n     In this story, the elves disrupt the economic productivity of the farm by interfering with the boy's ability to look after the cattle (PJ 2.11). It is only through the quick intervention of the farmhand who, coincidentally, is also engaged in normal farm-based economic activity, that the boy is saved. The encounter with the elves marks the boy for the rest of his life, and underscores the continuing and potentially long-lasting danger that these supernatural beings pose. \n\n     The relationship Margrete draws between elves and alder wood builds on a common false etymology. The word Danish word for elves, elvefolk, is often pronounced ellefolk. The presumed root would link it to elletr\u00e6 (alder wood). The root of elvefolk actually derives from the old common Nordic root, \u00e1lfr.

In Sweden, the same spirit is known as the tomte, and in Norway, the gardvord. The word nisse is a diminutive of the very common name Niels, and thus implies a small farmhand (Feilberg 2, 687). In her story, Margrete uses a common short form of the term, referring to the nisse as \"nis.\"\n\n     In her stories, Margrete emphasizes the economic aspects of the nisse's endeavors. The barter component of the first story should not be overlooked: in exchange for a relatively simple meal, the nisse insures a bountiful dairy output. (PJ 2.03). Nisse's seemingly excessive reaction the small portion of butter is in keeping with the extreme nature of these beings. \n\n     As with any out group transaction, value systems often do not align. A seemingly small transgression to an in group member may be quite significant to the out group, here represented by nisse. This differing value system is confirmed in the next two stories that also focus on the economics of the farm. In the first story, the nisse reveals his capacity for excess production, a form of wishful thinking on the part of farm workers. In the last of the three stories, the extreme reaction of the nisse confirms the frightening and potentially catastrophic misalignment of the human and the supernatural value systems. \n\n      The manner in which the farmhand dies echoes the death of another farmhand in one of Margrete's earlier ghost stories (AMJ 2.08). In the manuscript, there is a direct reference, missing in the published version, to Margrete's mother-in-law's ability to see ghosts. In this manner, Margrete proposes an intriguing connection between many of the supernatural beings that populate her stories and, in particular, the nisse and ghosts.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Plejemoder var fra Egaa og tjente Niels\nAndersen der.

It is unclear whose money it is he is counting, but in the context of Margrete's other stories of solicitous, guilty haunts, it is fairly clear that the money represents ill-gotten gains. The death of his animals at the time of his death may be linked to the nisse and his loyalty to a single farm and single farmer. This resonates with one of Margrete's first stories, in which a farmhand mentions that the mound dweller would only work with him on a specific farm (AMJ 1.05). \n\n     The conjuring of Anders V\u00e6ver proceeds without comment. Margrete endorses the common position of the minister as a successful ghost buster. That Anders himself possesses supernatural power goes without saying and may be part of the reason that he haunts. \n\n     The unusual phenomena that the men encounter when they try to steal Anders's apples are reminiscent of similar phenomena that distract people from successfully digging up buried treasure. In both cases, there is a suggestion that attempts to benefit economically without engaging in hard work are linked to the devil. Anders's willingness to wager with the men may also play a role in his subsequent haunting.\n\n      In the published collections, this story is separated from the preceding one, despite the clear narrative connection apparent in the field diaries. In the published version, the order of events is reversed so that the story of Anders V\u00e6ver's conjuring comes last, rather than first.

Furrows are often seen as efficacious against magic, but usually only when they are crossed (thereby inscribing a cross into the ground), rather than being followed as they are here. \n\n      The manor lord's actions are intriguing: he brings into the open Puust-Maren's abilities as a witch, but does not raise a formal accusation of witchcraft against her. Her actions could be seen as self incrimination, a form of testimony that was not allowed in the Danish witch trials that ended in the eighteenth century (Johansen 1991; Tangherlini 2000). This prohibition against self incrimination may also explain Puust-Maren's willingness to admit to having caused her daughter's deformity.\n\n      The second story highlights another common belief about witches, namely their ability to cause illness. Certain methods, such as placing a broom at the threshold to the house, were seen as efficacious against the ability of the witch to gain entrance to a house. Strewing certain seeds, such as linseed at the threshold, could be similarly efficacious (DS V 1111). \n\n     The story may point toward the fierce competition that existed between local folk healers. Stories such as this could bolster the reputation of the successful folk healer, while casting aspersions on another. In this context, it is worth noting that one person's folk healer might be another person's witch (Muchembled 1979).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Kone i Skj\u00f8dstrup h. hed Puust\nMaren og kunde hegse og gj\u00f8re s. mange Kun-\nster.

If she could make all his plows to stop at once, then he'd believe it. All his people were out in the fields plowing. Sure, that was an easy matter for her, she could stop all of them except for one, he knew a lot of magic himself, that farmhand, because as long as he was in the furrow, she couldn't do it, since he knew a lot of magic too.

Now when she was reading (the woman from Aarhus) and was curing the sick one, then Maren came and was so upset that it was dangerous and the man stood at the ready with the club and hit her as hard as he could and Maren didn't manage to do anything and had to go home. \"I wouldn't have thought that there was such magic here,\" said Maren, \"because then you could have let me known, and I could have cured her as well.

Sure, that was an easy matter for her, she could stop all of them except for one, he knew a lot of magic himself, that farmhand, because as long as he was in the furrow, she couldn\u2019t do it, as soon as he got out of it, then she could. But she couldn\u2019t do it in any other way than to make the horses stampede, and the manor lord had to promise not to regret that or get angry about that. No, he wouldn\u2019t. Then all the plows except one stopped. Something broke on all the farmhands\u2019 plows: for some, the blade broke, for some, the jointer knife broke, and for others, the harnesses broke. But when the one farmhand, who was still plowing, came out at the end, the horses got so wild, and they smashed the plow and they ran off across several fields and damaged the horses and everything. \u201cNow I believe that you can,\u201d says the manor lord, \u201csince you\u2019ve done it. That was bad enough, but you won\u2019t be punished for it. But if you do it to others, then you won\u2019t be able to avoid being accused [of witchcraft]. I\u2019ve heard how you even made your own daughter wing-mouthed because she wanted Per Virring.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s was true enough.\n     One time she\u2019d also made a woman so sick and then another woman from \u00c5rhus had to cure her because she was a bit wiser than Maren. But then the sick woman\u2019s husband was supposed to stand when Maren came--because come she would--and hit her in the forehead with a wooden club [n\u00f8dde], otherwise the one from \u00c5rhus couldn\u2019t cure her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll probably kill her.\u201d No, they couldn\u2019t kill her, it wouldn\u2019t even hurt. Then the man was so afraid that she\u2019d sneak in the door past him, but then the woman from \u00c5rhus said that she\u2019d put a birch broom [ruflime] or a straw broom [sliklime] in the door, she knew that she couldn\u2019t go over that. Now when the cunning woman was reading and curing the sick one, then Maren came and was incredibly angry. The man was ready with the club and hit her as hard as he could. Maren couldn't to do anything then and had to go home. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that there was such magic here,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause then you could have let me known, and I could have cured her as well.

In this case, Margrete proposes that the local minister is the most competent to deal successfully with the disruptive force of the haunt.\n\n     By the nineteenth century, infanticide was a relatively rare cause of death, possibly a result of the progressive policies enacted in the eighteenth century that were intended to prevent it. Infant mortality for the Danish countryside through the nineteenth century ranged from a low of 6% to a high of nearly 25% (L\u00f8kke 2002). L\u00f8kke notes that approximately 10% of all rural births were out of wedlock--this percentage fell in the latter parts if the century as legal reforms were enacted and rural economic organization was liberalized. In the last decades of the century, it was common practice for couples to marry after the birth of their first child.\n\n     Executions in the early part of the century were often major events. Local soldiers surrounded the gallows to prevent people from getting too close to the spectacle (Steensberg 1964, 318). Capital punishment became less and less common during the course of the century. Christian V.'s Danske Lov, which was still in effect until 1866, allowed for the execution of a wide range of criminals, primarily to serve as examples for others. Earlier forms of execution and torture that included branding, dismemberment and the public display of the criminal's dismembered body, were abolished in 1833. Simple execution such as hanging was still allowed in the reformed law of 1866 for crimes such as murder and crimes against the state. The death penalty was not abolished in Denmark until the punishment reform law of 1930.", "danish_manuscript": "Paa pr\u00e6stegaardsmarken alleryderst ligger\nGalgeknolden.

There was a nisse who lived in a hollow ash tree in the commons, and he went and fed both the horses and the cows. My stepmother was herself born on Christmas morning, and so she could see him. She often saw him in the alley when he had to go get water, and he said to her that she shouldn\u2019t be afraid of him because he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Anders V\u00e6ver said to some other men that he\u2019d make a large bet with them that they couldn\u2019t steal any apples from his garden. So they tried it. Some were supposed to go up into the apple tree and shake it, and the others would pick them up. But then a big animal came which looked like a fox and pushed them all to the side and all these roosters appeared and fluttered about the people who were up in the tree so they didn\u2019t get any apples, and that was because of the nisse. This Anders V\u00e6ver sat at the head of the table after he\u2019d died and counted his money, and it sounded like sacks were being dragged about in the attic since he\u2019d probably committed a crime by not measuring properly. Most of the animals died, and if the son hadn\u2019t dragged the rest to L\u00f8gten and sold them there, then they all would have died. He had three children and one son, but they ended up so bad off all of them. The son was miserable with cancer that ate right through his entire throat.

The use of oxen to find the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contradistinction to the communal elements of the church. Also, allowing oxen to roam free and, in other variants, at night, runs counter to normal roles for domesticated animals: their grazing is usually limited and they are not used productively at night.

At the end of the nineteenth century, taxation was a hot button topic in political debate, and there was significant discussion over the degree to which taxes should be administered locally or should be returned to the central administration of the national government. With the constitution, the Crown was less in control of tax revenue as it had been during the period of the absolute monarchy.\n\n     Dragons guarding treasures are known in Nordic tradition back through the middle ages. Grundtvig's translations of Snorri and Saxo made such stories broadly accessible in rural Denmark. Perhaps the best known of the medieval dragons guarding treasure is Fafnir, who turns himself into a dragon to protect a hoard of ill-gotten gold.\n\n     Tang Kristensen misrecorded the name of the castle, as there is no castle on Kalv\u00f8 (near Skanderborg). Cistercian monks had used Kalv\u00f8, but left no structure that could be considered a castle. Given the next story, it is clear that Margrete was referring to the nearby Kal\u00f8 castle, which had been built in the late middle ages, and was used sporadically through the nineteenth century.

Peat, a common fuel for heating, is not supposed to be dug at midnight. In fact no activity is supposed to take place at this late hour outside the farm at all, and certainly not in the middle of an intersection, where it would disrupt traffic. The intersection forms a cross, and thus should have religious power, but here it is used in a non-religious, or perhaps even anti-religious fashion. Toads are generally seen as connected to Satan and witches, even though they can also be considered good luck omens. Toads figure prominently as ingredients in various magical potions, as is the case here. Attending church at midnight and blowing through the keyhole are two common ways to come into contact with Satan. \n\n     The genie resonates with Margrete's folktale about the genie in the bottle (AMJ 2.02), although in this story the genie has a more ominous origin, and does not derive from a normal, albeit somewhat questionable, economic transaction. \n\n     Oddly, the published version does not include the motif of burying the toad in the peat stack.", "danish_manuscript": "Naar de gik til en Korsvej kl. 12 3 tors\ndag aftener og grave en T\u00f8rv, s. skulde der\nkomme en Skruptusse og den skulde de tage\n[dem] og grave [den] ned der, under, den T\u00f8rv\nfinde den.

Another magical seed is linseed, used to prevent the passage of witches (DS V 1111 and DS IV 744). The written piece of paper to which Margrete alludes was a common feature in magical practice.

Then he'd grant me three promises. I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck and after we'd gone a little bit the dogs come running after me too and then the hunters come too. They said that I must have some fresh slaughtered meat in my bag. Then I said that I didn't have anything other than the rags that I couldn't sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See then they called their dogs off and then when I'd gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now, because now there wasn't any danger anymore. When he'd left, I wanted to try if there was anything to these promises and so I turned myself into an ant first, but it didn't go far down the road. So I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away to another kingdom and I fell down there right in front of the princess's windows and she had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry and a duck and then she placed the rusks on the table and I went in. She slams the window shut. Not the first but the next night, I wanted to try to lie with her and turned myself into a man. She shouted: Father, father, there is a man with me. He came in there. So I turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. So they couldn't find me. She'd dreamt it. Same way for three nights. Then the king said that if she called him again, she'd be punished. If she wouldn't keep quiet. Then she talked to me. It continued like this for a while. One day the king came in there and she said to him that she wanted to have that bird. You already have it. But I want to have it as my husband. A strange husband. He can also turn himself into a man. I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. Well, since you can do so much, then you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, then you can have her. Well, I didn't know about that. So I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. I came to an inn, they were sitting and talking about this mound dweller, and I learned there where the mountain was. I turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. She was home alone. The mound man was out. Jesus Christ, how did you get in here. Well, I... You're unlucky. In the first room, there was a closet with so many human skulls in it, in the second, a closet with so much clothes, and in the third, so many dead bodies lay. When you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, since he can kill so many people. Then he'll say there is Christian blood in here. You should answer he knows that you are Christian. You have to leave now. No, I'll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, I want to hear how he answers you. Then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Asks him where his heart was. Ugh, there is Christian blood in here. You know that I'm Christian. He gets up and looked in all the rooms. Back into bed again. My heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and that's in a duck, and that's in a fox, and that is in a dragon, and that is at a manor farm and if they don't get it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom. Then I crept up out of the mountain again, and I went to the manor farm and the manor lord. Didn't he need a farmhand. Yes, a swineherd since the dragon laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. When the swine weren't fat enough. You probably don't want to be that. Sure, I can probably lay waste to him. The first day, a Monday, I was to go out, I got seven fat swine to drive. To the dragon. Good day, Dragon. Thank you. Are you to have these. Yes, that's what I've gotten each weekday. Let's fight for them. I turned myself into a lion and then we fight. If only he'd had one of those swine, then he would have torn me into such small pieces that they wouldn't have been able to pick all of me up in eight days. If I'd had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he'd been crushed in a mill. Then I won the swine and came back to the manor lord with them. The manor lord was worried and scared that the dragon would destroy his land and kingdoms. It's good for him to go hungry a bit, I'm a strong young man. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. Good day, Dragon. Thank you... lion... fight... third Monday twenty-one... Manager a bite of bread and a dram along to give me when I asked for it. Then I won the twenty-one fat swine. Then I ripped the dragon to death and a fox came out. Tore apart. Duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. Tore apart. Egg to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got my shoulder sack and the egg in it. The manor lord wanted to give me so much but I wasn't too interested, and I set off to get back to the mound man. He was lying on top and was so sick. Oh dear God, is it you that has my heart? Yes. Oh, can't I have it back? Yes, if you'll send the princess you have down there with you back to land just as nice and healthy as when you took her. Yes, he'd certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Followed her home to her father and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous and I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed onto me, and they flew with me to the third B\u00e6rmose  and then I fell down and that's how I came here and could tell you this lie.", "danish_publication": "Da a var ude at gj\u00e6re min sidste M\u00f8nstring, da kom Mikkel R\u00e6v til mig og spurgte mig, om a vilde ikke b\u00e6re ham lidt i min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k, for Skytterne de vilde skyde ham, saa vilde han give mig tre L\u00f8fter, og det var, te a kunde skabe mig i en Myre, i en L\u00f8ve og i en And. Da vi kommer lidt hen, saa kommer ogsaa Hundene rendende efter mig, og bag efter kommer Skytten jo ogsaa. De sagde, a maatte have noget Ferskeri i min Pose, men a sagde, a havde ikke andet end de Pjalter, a kunde ikke s\u00e6lge og faa noget for, a havde vel Lov til at have i min Pose, hvad a vilde, og de skulde v\u00e6rsgod og snevve deres Hunde. Se, saa snevvede de dem og, og da a saa var kommen lidt l\u00e6ngere hen, saa sagde Mikkel til mig, nu maatte a godt lade ham gaa, for nu var der ingen Fare. Da han saa var kommen af min Pose og rendt hans Vej, vilde a pr\u00f8ve, om der var ogsaa noget ved de L\u00f8fter, han havde givet mig. A skabte mig f\u00f8rst i en Myre, og det gik nu godt nok. Men det saa lidt hen ad Vejen saadan at rende som Myre, og saa skabt a mig i en And og fl\u00f8j saa langt saa langt hen, til a kom i et andet Kongerige. Der faldt a ned lige for Prinsessens V\u00f8nderer, og hun fik mig at se og havde aldrig set saa p\u00e6n en Fugl. Hun lukte V\u00f8nderet op og lagde Tvebakker i Karmen, og a var jo sulten og gav mig til at \u00e6de af dem. Hun lagde Tvebakker paa Bordet, og a fl\u00f8j ind. Saa sm\u00e6kkede hun V\u00f8nderet i, og nu blev a inde ved hende. Den f\u00f8rste Dag blev a ved at v\u00e6re Fugl, men saa den anden Aften vilde a pr\u00f8ve at ligge ved hende og skabte mig da i en Karl igien. Hun raabte: \u201dFader, Fader, der er Mandfolk hos mig!\u201d og han kom jo l\u00f8bende derind, men a skabte mig jo strags i en Myre og satte mig inde under Sengen. Nu kunde de ikke finde mig, og saa sagde Kongen, hun havde dr\u00f8mt det. Saadan bar a mig ogsaa ad den Tredje Aften. Hun kaldte paa hendes Fader og han kom, men a var jo i en Myre og sa under Sengen. Saa sagde Kongen, at hvis hun saadan narrede ham tiere, saa skulde hun have Straf, for han vilde ikke tiere saadan kaldes op. Den Gang a saa havde gjort mig til Karl igien, og hun m\u00e6rkede, a var der, saa snakkede hun til mig, og vi blev da godt kjendt med hinanden. Det stod saa hen et stort Stykke Tid. En Dag Kongen kom derind, saa sagde hun; \u201dA vil have den Fugl.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDen har du jo,\u201d siger han. \u201dJammen, a vil have den til Mand.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDet var da en s\u00e6r Mand,\u201d siger Kongen. Ja-a, han kunde ogsaa skabe sig til Karl. \u201dDet var noget,\u201d siger Kongen, og i det samme gj\u00f8r a mig til Karl, og staar og snakker med dem. \u201dJa, naar du kan saa meget,\u201d siger han, \u201dsaa kan du skaffe den Prinsesse hjem, som Bj\u00e6rgmanden har taget for nogle Aar siden, og naar du kommer med hende, saa skal du faa min Datter.\u201d Ja, det vidste a ikke, om a turde tage mig paa. Jo, det skulde a, nu var Kongen bleven opsat paa det, og saa maa a ud at vandre igjen med min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k paa min Nakke. Endelig kom a til en Kro, hvor de sad og snakkede om den Bj\u00e6rgmand, og der fik a at vide, hvor Bj\u00e6rget var. A kom derhen, skabte mig i en Myre, og kr\u00f8b derned. Lige i Tiden var Prinsessen enlig hjemme, Bj\u00e6rgmanden var et sted henne, hvor det var. \u201dJ\u00f8s Kors hvordan er du kommen her ind?\u201d siger hun. \u2013 Ja, a var da kommen her. \u201dAa, du er ulykkelig,\u201d siger hun, \u201ddu kommer aldrig levende herfra,\u201d og saa viste hun mig ind i det f\u00f8rste V\u00e6relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Menneskehoveder i. Dern\u00e6st kom a ind i det andet V\u00e6relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Kl\u00e6der i, og endelig kom a ind i det tredje hvor der laa saa mange d\u00f8de Kroppe. Saa siger a til hende: \u201dNaar han nu kommer hjem, og du kommer i Seng i Aften, saa skal du sp\u00f8rge ham hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte er, for han maa da ikke have det med sig, siden han kan undlive saa mange.\u201d Ja, det skulde hun nok. Saa vil han vel nok sige: \u201dDer er Kristenblod herinde, men du skal svare ham han ved nok, du er en Kristen.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, du maa afsted nu,\u201d siger Prinsessen til mig og er saa angst. \u201dNej, a s\u00e6tter mig under Sengen i en Myre, for a vil h\u00f8re hvad han svarer dig.\u201d Naa, saa kom Bj\u00e6rgmanden, og de fik deres Aftensmad, og kom saa i Seng. Saa sp\u00f8rger hun ham, hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte var. \"Du maa jo ikke have det ved dig, siden du kan undlive saa mange.\u201d \u2013 \u201dFyfy, der er Kristenblod her inde,\u201d siger han. \u201dAa, du ved nok, a er en Kristen,\u201d siger hun. Men det vilde han ikke give sig tilfreds med, og han op, og de ledte i alle V\u00e6relserne. Men de fandt jo ingen Ting, og han maa til at i Seng igien. Hun sp\u00f8rger atter om, hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte var. \u201dMit Hj\u00e6rte, det kan ingen faa, det er inden i et \u00c6g, og det \u00c6g er i en And, og den And er i en R\u00e6v, og den er inden i en Drage, og den Drage er ved en Herregaard. Hvis de ikke skaffer dem syv fede Svin hver Ugedag, saa l\u00e6gger den Lande og Rige \u00f8de.\u201d Den Gang a havde nu h\u00f8rt det, saa kr\u00f8b a op paa Bj\u00e6rget igien, og a rejste af hen til den Herregaard. A kommer til Herremanden og sp\u00f8rger ham, om han tr\u00e6ngte ingen Karle for. Jo, han tr\u00e6ngte for en Svinhyrde, for der var en Drage, der lagde saa mange Hjorder \u00f8de for ham. Det gjorde han, naar Svinene var ikke fede nok, som han skulde have. \u201dMen den Bestilling vil du vel ikke gj\u00e6rne have.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJo, det er mig det samme,\u201d siger a, \u201da kan nok l\u00e6gge ham \u00f8de.\u201d Naa ja, saa kom a i Pladsen. Den f\u00f8rste Dag, a skulde ud med Svinene, det var en Mandag, og a fik syv fede Svin at drive med. Saa kommer a til Dragen. \u201dGod Dag, Drage,\u201d siger a. \u201dTak,\u201d siger han. \u201dSkal du have dine fede Svin?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, de har a faaet hver Ugedag.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDet vil vi slaas om,\u201d siger a, og saa skaber a mig i en L\u00f8ve og slaas med ham. Endelig siger han: Gud a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have revet dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.\u201d A bad til, a havde haft en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram, saa skulde a have reven ham saa smaa, som han var m\u00f8llemaald. Saa gav han tabt, og a vandt Svinene og kom hjem til Herremanden med dem. Han var s\u00f8rgen og r\u00e6d for Dragen, te den vild l\u00e6gge Lande og Riger \u00f8de for ham, som den havde truet med, men a var jo frisk Karl og viste ham Svinene. \u201dHan har godt af at sulte noget,\u201d siger a. Den n\u00e6ste Mandag skulde Forvalteren med for at se, hvordan det gik til. Da havde a fjorten fede Svin med, for Herremanden var bange for at beholde dem. Saa kom den og var ikke saa meget god. \u201dGod Dag Drage,\u201d siger a. \u201dTak,\u201d siger den. \u201dSkal du have dine fede Svin?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, den kan a nok tr\u00e6nge til.\u201d  \u2013 \u201dJa, det vil vi slaas om,\u201d og a gj\u00f8r mig til en L\u00f8ve og slaas paa Liv og D\u00f8d med ham. Der falder nu den sammen snak imellem os, og det stod Forvalteren jo og h\u00f8rte paa. Endelig blev Dragen kjed af at slaas med mig, og saa drog a hjem med mine svin. Men Herremanden kunde endnu ikke rigtig falde i Ro og han vilde have, a skulde drage af med 21 Svin den n\u00e6ste Mandag. Forvalteren skulde med, og han skulde have en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram med at fly mig, naar a forlangte det. Vi kom saa til at slaas for tredje Gang, og da vi havde slaas paa Liv og D\u00f8d en Tid, saa siger Dragen: \u201dGid a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have reven dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.\u201d Men a sagde; \u201dHavde a nu en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram, saa skulde a rive dig saa smaa, som du var m\u00f8llemaald.\u201d Strags springer Forvalteren til og jager det i mig, og saa tog a fat igjen og fik Magt med Dragen, saa nu havde a vundet de 21 fede Svin. A rev Dragen ihjel, og saa kom der en R\u00e6v ud. Den rev a ogsaa ihjel, og saa fl\u00f8j der en And ud af den og satte sig paa en Sten i Havet. A gj\u00f8r mig i en And og flyver ud efer den. A river den ihjel, og saa falder der et \u00c6g ud, og det falder til Havsens Bund. A ned efter det, og saa fik a \u00c6gget i min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k og rejser af tilbage til Herremanden. Han vilde have givet mig saa meget, for det a havde frelst ham fra Dragen, men det br\u00f8d a mig ikke om, a satte efter at komme tilbage til Bj\u00e6rget. Da a kom der, laa han ovenpaa og var saa syg. \u201dAa Herre G...,\u201d siger han, \u201der det dig, der har mit Hj\u00e6rte?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det er.\u201d \u2013 \u201dAa, maa a da ikke faa det?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJo, naar du vil fly den Prinsesse i Land, du har her nede ved dig, og det lige saa from og lige saa sund, som da du tog hende.\u201d Jo, det skulde han nok. Saa gik han ned og hent hende og hun kom i Land. Nu fulgte hun med mig hjem til hendes Faders Land, og der blev saadan Gl\u00e6de, da a kom med hende, saa det var farligt. A skulde nu have Prinsessen og det halve Kongerige strags, og det andet halve, naar Kongen d\u00f8de. Men Gud bedre det, dem, der har meget, de vil have mere. Den ottende Dag efter Brylluppt stod a og saa ud over Slottet, og der saa a en Flok Vilgj\u00e6s. A skabte mig saa i en And og fl\u00f8j op og vilde have dem, men saa kom a imellem T\u00f8mmen af dem, og de fl\u00f8j med mig til tredje B\u00e6rmose, og saa faldt a ned. Derfor kom a hertil og kunde fort\u00e6lle jer den L\u00f8gn.", "english_publication": "When I was out doing my last inspection, Michael Fox came up to me and asked me if I couldn\u2019t carry him a bit in my shoulder bag, because the hunters wanted to shoot him, and he\u2019d give me three promises, and they were that I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck. After we\u2019d gone a little bit, the dogs came running after me, and behind them the hunters came too. They said that I must have some freshly slaughtered meat in my bag, but I said that I didn\u2019t have anything other than the rags that I couldn\u2019t sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See, then they called their dogs off and then when I\u2019d gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now because there wasn\u2019t any danger anymore. When he\u2019d gotten out of my bag and run off, I wanted to test if there was anything to these promises he\u2019d given me. I turned myself into an ant first and that went well enough. But I didn\u2019t get far down the road running there like an ant, so I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away until I came to another kingdom. I fell down right in front of the princess\u2019s windows and she saw me and had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry that I started to eat them. She placed the rusks on the table and I flew in. Then she slammed the window shut, and now I was inside with her. The first day I stayed a bird, but then the next night I wanted to try to lie with her and so I turned myself into a man again. She shouted: \u201cFather, father, there is a man here in my room!\u201d and he came running in there, but I immediately turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. Now they couldn\u2019t find me, and then the king said that she\u2019d dreamed it. I did the same thing the third night. She called for her father and he came, but I was an ant and sat under the bed. Then the king said that if she tricked him again, she\u2019d be punished because he didn\u2019t want to be called like that anymore. Then after I\u2019d turned myself into a man again and she noticed that I was there, she talked to me and we got to know each other well. It continued like this for a while. One day when the king had come in there, she said to him, \u201cI want to have that bird.\u201d\u2014\u201cYou already have it,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, but I want to have it as my husband.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a strange husband,\u201d says the king. \u201cYes, well he can also turn himself into a man.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d says the king, and at that moment, I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. \u201cWell, since you can do so much,\u201d he says, \u201cthen you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, and when you come with her, you\u2019ll get my daughter.\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t know if I dared take on that task. Yes, I had to, now the king had gotten set on that, and so I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. Finally I came to an inn where they were sitting, talking about this mound dweller, and I learned where the mountain was. I got out there, turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. Right at that time, the princess was home alone, the mound man was somewhere else, wherever it was. \u201cJesus Christ, how did you get in here?\u201d she says. Yes, I\u2019d come here. \u201cOh, you\u2019re unlucky,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ll never get out of here alive,\u201d and then she showed me into the first room, there was a closet there with lots and lots of human skulls in it. Next I came into the second room, there was a closet with lots and lots of clothes, and finally I came into the third room where there were lots and lots of dead bodies lying about. Then I say to her, \u201cNow when he comes home, and you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, because he can\u2019t have it with him, since he can kill so many people.\u201d Yes, she\u2019d certainly do that. Then he\u2019ll probably say, \u201cThere is Christian blood in here, but you should answer him that he knows darn well that you are Christian.\u201d \u201cYes, you have to leave now,\u201d says the Princess to me and is so worried. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, because I want to hear how he answers you.\u201d Well, then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Then she asks him where his heart was. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it with you, since you can kill so many people.\u201d \u201cUgh, there is Christian blood in here,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, you know darn well that I\u2019m Christian,\u201d she says. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied with that, and he gets up, and they looked in all the rooms. But they didn\u2019t find anything, and he had to go back to bed. She asks him again where his heart was. \u201cMy heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and the egg is inside a duck, and that duck is inside a fox, and that is inside a dragon, and that dragon is at a manor farm. If they don\u2019t give it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom.\u201d When I\u2019d heard that, I climbed up out of the mountain again, and I went off to the manor farm. I go up to the manor lord and ask him if he didn\u2019t need a farmhand. Yes, he certainly needed a farmhand since there was a dragon that laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. He did that whenever the swine he was to have weren\u2019t fat enough. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t want to have that job.\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, it\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d I say, \u201cI can probably lay waste to him.\u201d OK, so I got the job. The first day I was to go out with the swine, and I was given seven fat swine to drive. Then I get to the dragon, \u201cGood day, Dragon,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you to have these fat swine?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve gotten each weekday.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s fight for them,\u201d I say, and then I turn myself into a lion and then I fight him. Finally he says, \u201cIf only I\u2019d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.\u201d And I said that if I\u2019d had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he\u2019d been crushed in a mill. Then he gave in, and I won the swine and came home to the manor lord with them. He was afraid of the dragon and was worried that he\u2019d destroy his land and kingdoms like he\u2019d threatened, but I was a fit young man and showed him the swine. It\u2019s good for him to go hungry a bit, I say. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen fat swine with me, because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. \u201cGood day, Dragon,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you,\u201d it says. \u201cDo you want these fat swine?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, I could certainly use them.\u201d\u2014\u201cSure, let\u2019s fight for them,\u201d and I turn myself into a lion and we fight for life and death over them. We have the same conversation and the manager stood there and listened to that. Finally, the dragon got tired of fighting with me, and then I went home with my swine. But the manor lord still couldn\u2019t settle down, and he wanted me to go off with twenty-one swine the next Monday. The manager was to come with me, and he was to bring a bite of bread and a dram to give me when I asked for it. We started fighting for the third time, and after we\u2019d fought for life and death for a while, the dragon says, \u201cIf only I\u2019d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.\u201d But I said: \u201cIf I had a bite of bread and a dram, then I\u2019d tear you into pieces so small it would be as if you'd been crushed in a mill.\u201d The manager immediately jumps in and stuffs it in me, and then I went to it again and got power over the dragon, so now I\u2019d won the twenty-one fat swine. I tore the dragon to pieces and killed him, and then a fox came out. I tore that one apart and killed it too, and then a duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. I tear it to pieces and kill it, and then an egg falls out, and it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got the egg in my shoulder sack and go back to the manor lord. He wanted to give me so much, since I\u2019d saved him from the dragon, but I wasn\u2019t too interested, and I set off to get back to the mountain. When I got there, he [the mound dweller] was lying on top of it and was so sick. \u201cOh dear God...,\u201d he says, \u201cis it you that has my heart?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, can\u2019t I have it back?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, if you\u2019ll send the princess you have down there with you back to land, and just as nice and healthy as when you took her.\u201d Yes, he\u2019d certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Then she followed me home to her father\u2019s land, and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous. I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day after the wedding, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed on to me, and they flew with me to the third B\u00e6rmose (B\u00e6r swamp) and then I fell down. That\u2019s how I came here and could tell you this lie."}, {"story_id": 368, "full_name": "90 - 4.01 - Unpub_AMJ_401", "publication_info": "Unpub_AMJ_401", "annotation": "A short recording of biographical data that Tang Kristensen managed to gather from Margrete.

Although the tale at first blush seems believable, the manor lord's eventual slaughter of the beggars-turned-robbers brings to mind tales cataloged as ATU 956, \"The Hot Chamber in the House of Robbers\", and its close analogs (ATU 956a and b).\n\n      The story has two distinct parts: The first part deals with the vengeful nature of Klaus and his family after they have been put off their farm. The second part deals with the attack on the farm by the \"robbers\" and the manor lord's strength and ability to protect the farmers in his district.\n\n     Peder addresses several critical issues in this the first story that he told Tang Kristensen. The parceling of farms after the land reforms of 1780 led to a significant increase in the number of farms and houses that were no longer leaseholds. After the reorganization of the fields, many people discovered that, despite the proximity of their fields to their neighbors, the fields could be of greatly differing quality. \n\n     The parceling of lands also required that people, long used to a different mode of existence, were now forced to confront the demands of self sufficiency and the rough and tumble of a free market economy (Christiansen 1996 and 1975). In some cases, farmers were unable to keep up with the demands of the new economic structures, and ultimately were forced off their land. Those vacated farms were either offered to new farmers or bought out by neighbors. \n\n     At the time when Peder told this story, care of the poor and the causes of poverty were subjects of great currency in local political debates. Most people agreed that there were two classes of paupers: those who deserved help since they were poor through no fault of their own (advanced age, poverty, feebleness), and those who did not deserve help since they were poor by choice (drunks, able-bodied poor, freeloaders) (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). Legislation after the 1860s recognized these different classes of poor. Those who could work but chose not to were often forced onto labor farms (fattigg\u00e5rde) (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). In Peder's story, the family which is too lazy to work is first thrown off their land, and later executed.\n\n     Peder also addresses the problem of beggars and vagabonds in this story, a problem that animates Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter's storytelling. In Peder's story, the lazy farmer and his family become wandering craftsmen. An alternate reading is that they are simply masquerading as potters and are actually earning their keep as thieves. The later reference to them as \"robbers\" suggests this reading may be more accurate. In either case, the implication that wandering merchants were shifty characters aligns well with much of the debate concerning care for the poor and legislation aimed at stemming the tide of rural begging and wandering (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).  \n\n     The strategy that Poul and his hired girl adopt to eliminate the threat posed by Klaus and his sons has a fairly harsh outcome. The \"one that got away\" allows for the threat to persist, and resists a positive resolution.\n\n      Paradoxically, the return of Klaus's family, now robbers, is heralded by another wanderer. The warning comes as repayment for Poul's previously generous and merciful treatment of that wanderer. Many rural communities encouraged legislation that relied on the goodwill of the population, rather than the burden of additional taxes, to provide for the poor. A story such as this would, of course, provide grist for the rhetorical mill supporting that policy.\n\n     The manor lord's protection of the farmer hearkens back to a previous era, when the farms in the district were owned by the manor, and protection of the estate was a prime responsibility of the lord (Christiansen 1996). Although the manor lord protects Poul and his family, he also takes quite a bit, represented symbolically in this tale by the preposterously large meal that he eats. The meal is so large, in fact, that it becomes memorialized in the landscape, lending its name to a local town (based on the false etymological equation: Dover = davre = breakfast). \n\n     The use of etiological tags, such as Dover, can anchor a story in the immediate locale. In narrative, etiological tags act as a form of external confirmation while, at the same time, attach the story to recognizable features of the landscape.\n\n    The published version of the story differs little from the manuscript version.", "danish_manuscript": "Der boede en M. i Illerup, der hed Hjelmslev\nog h. var Herremd. og det var et Mske der var\nbekjendt for at v\u00e6re s. voldsom st\u00e6rk.

Det var en\nHolt, og der er nu et Hus som kaldes\nHjelmslev huset.", "english_manuscript": "There was a man who lived in Illerup who was called Hjelmslev and he was a manor lord. He was renowned for being immensely strong. When he sat in a chair he was so strong that seven farmhands could tie a rope around him and still couldn't pull him out of the chair. He had a sword that had a name I can't remember, nor how big it was. He ruled the peasant farms in the area. Half way between Dover church and Illerup there were two solitary farms, and in one of them there was a man who had six sons, but they wouldn't do a thing and so they couldn't pay their debts. He forced them out of the house, and nobody came to live there afterward since it had been so damaged that nobody could live there, and so he put the land under another farmstead. The man who lived there was called Poul, but I can't remember the other one's name, I think it was Klaus. So now these seven vagabonds had nothing to eat, and since the manor lord was the reason they didn't have any bread, they swore that he'd experience misfortune, but first Poul would get what he had coming to him since it was him who'd gotten their property. They disappeared completely from the area, and people neither heard from them nor asked about them for quite a while until people thought they were dead and gone and they wouldn't see them again. Poul had been afraid, but now he felt safe again. Then late one winter evening, a potter came and wanted to stay at Poul's place and since he was a kind person, he said yes right away as usual. The man wanted to get his wagon under cover, but it wasn't possible because back then people didn't have as large houses as they do now, there wasn't any more shelter than for themselves. It wound up being parked just outside next to a pond of water. Just about bed time, the hired girl went out to get a bucket of water and she hears some people speaking inside the wagon. So she goes over and listens and it turns out to be one of Klaus's sons and Klaus himself who are lying there talking, wondering if the people weren't going to go to bed soon, it was ridiculous how long it was taking. She goes back inside and in the meantime they'd set up a bed for the other one, and he had already gone to bed. She tells Poul what she'd heard, and they agree to go out and tip the wagon with all the pots and everything else down into that water hole. Then they hurried around behind the end of the house and stand there listening, because it was really close to the house that waterhole. Then they see the other one come jumping out of the window, but there wasn't anything he could do, the other two had drowned. When he realized that, he ran away and left the horses and the wagon behind. A little while passed, but in the quiet week just before Maundy Thursday, a poor person came running as fast as he could to Poul and told him that he'd been sleeping in a barn out on Sjelle heath the previous night and he'd lain there and listened to how the other five had plotted that on Maundy Thursday morning, they'd kill him. Since Poul had been nice to him, he'd do him the favor of telling him. Poul didn't know what to do, he couldn't run away and desert his house and cattle, since then they'd just destroy everything. By the same token he couldn't let himself be destroyed, and in this way he ate up the day. When it started to get really light, he started to get uneasy. But just then the manor lord Hjelmslev came riding by on his way to church. Then Poul went out to him and told him how things stood concerning these five guys. Then he said, \"Well, its possible that it's nothing other than a trick, but it could also be true. So if you'll treat me to a good meal, then I'll watch out for them, and if they come, I'll make up for it.\" You see, now they had other things to think about than these hooligans, now they had to serve up a meal for the manor lord who was a really big eater. There made huge preparations. Eggs and a shoulder of pork, that was the only pork they had in the house, but he ate it. As they were sitting there, right in the middle of the meal, the Dover church bell rang the last time, and as soon as it was done, the robbers began pounding on the door. Then the manor lord says, \"It's annoying how eager they are, can't you tell them to wait until I'm done?\" Poul also talked to them but they didn't pay too much attention. \"Well, sit down for a little while by the door, for God's sake, I want to finish.\" Now they pounded again, but it was a little door and they couldn't really get at it, and he said that if they'd wait just a second, he'd open the door voluntarily. So, satisfied, they gave him a little while. Eventually, he finished and then he got up from the table and took his saber and then said to Poul that he could open the door now, but they better not come more than one at a time. Poul did that too and they came only one at a time, and then the manor lord stood inside and chopped their heads off and kicked their bodies aside. They didn't suspect a thing, even though they thought that it took a while, but they didn't manage to warn each other before the last one was kaput. Then the manor lord said, \"Now I've made up for the meal.\" From that time on, the church has been called Dover church, and the place has been called Hjelmslev. The place. It was a small clearing and there's a cotter's place now which is called Hjelmslev house.", "danish_publication": "Der boede en herremand i Illerup, der hed Hjelmslev, og det var et menneske, der var bekjendt for at v\u00e6re s\u00e5 voldsom st\u00e6rk. N\u00e5r han sad i en stol og syv af de st\u00e6rkeste karle slog et reb om l\u00e6nden af ham, kunde de ikke tr\u00e6kke ham af stolen. Han havde et sv\u00e6rd, der havde et navn, som a ikke kan mindes, og m\u00e5let p\u00e5 det heller ikke. Den herremand r\u00e5dte for b\u00f8ndergodset der omkring. Midt vejs mellem Dover kirke og Illerup var to enstedg\u00e5rde, og i den ene var en mand, der havde 6 s\u00f6nner, men de vilde ingen ting bestille, og s\u00e5 kunde de ikke svare deres skyld. Herremanden jog dem da ud af huset, og der kom ingen igjen, for det var blevet s\u00e5 ramponeret, at ingen kunde bo i det, men jorden lagde han under et andet sted. Den mand hed Povl, men ham, der blev jaget v\u00e6k, han hed Klavs. Nu havde deher 7 drabanter jo ikke noget at ern\u00e6re dem ved, og da herren var skyld i, at de var bleven br\u00f8dl\u00f8se, svor de ham en ulykke, men f\u00f8rst skulde Povl have, for det var ham, der havde f\u00e5et deres ejendom. De forsvandt nu helt fra egnen, og folk hverken h\u00f8rte eller spurgte dem i l\u00e6ngere tid. S\u00e5 troede man, de var b\u00e5de d\u00f8d og v\u00e6k. Povl havde v\u00e6ret r\u00e6d en tid, men nu blev han tryg igjen. S\u00e5 en sildig aftenstund hen p\u00e5 vinteren kom der en pottekj\u00f8rer og vilde logere ind ved Povl, og da han var et godsindet menneske, sagde han straks ja som s\u00e6dvanlig. Vognen vilde manden haft i husly, men det kunde nu ikke lade sig gj\u00f8re, for i den tid var folk ikke s\u00e5 bemidlede med hus som nu om tider. Vognen kom da til at st\u00e5 udenfor lige ved siden af en vanddam. Hen ved sengedags gik pigen ud at hente en spand vand, og da h\u00f8rer hun nogen, der snakker i vognen. S\u00e5 g\u00e5r hun hen og st\u00e5r og lytter, og da er det en af Klavses s\u00f6nner og Klavs selv, der ligger og snakker, om folkene ikke snart kunde v\u00e6re g\u00e5ede til sengs, det var voldsomt, s\u00e5 lang tid det tog. Imeldergodlag hun havde v\u00e6ret ude, havde de f\u00e5et en seng stilt an til den anden, og han var g\u00e5et til sengs. S\u00e5 fort\u00e6ller hun Povl, hvad hun havde h\u00f8rt, og de kommer til ens om i al stilhed at g\u00e5 ud og v\u00e6lte vognen med potter og samt ned i det vandhul. Dern\u00e6st skubber de dem om ved enden af huset og st\u00e5r og lytter, for hullet var t\u00e6t derved. Da seer de, den anden kommer springende ud af vinduet, men nu var der ikke noget for dem at gj\u00f8re, de andre to var druknede, og da han m\u00e6rker det, str\u00f8g han af og lod b\u00e6ster og vogn i stikken. S\u00e5 gik der en lille tid, men s\u00e5 i den stille uge lige op til skj\u00e6rtorsdag kom der en stakkel strygende hen til Povl, alt hvad remmer og t\u00f6j kunde holde, og fortalte, at han havde logeret i en lade p\u00e5 Sjelle hede om natten og der ligget og h\u00f8rt, hvordan 5 personer havde lagt r\u00e5d op om at bes\u00f8ge ham skj\u00e6rtorsdag morgen, og s\u00e5 skulde kan f\u00e6ldes. Men for det Povl havde v\u00e6ret god imod ham, vilde han gj\u00f8re ham den tjeneste at komme over at sige ham det. Povl vidste ikke, hvad han skulde gj\u00f8re. Han kunde ikke rende fra det hele og lade hus og kv\u00e6g i stikken, for s\u00e5 lagde de det jo helt \u00f8de. Nej, s\u00e5 kunde han da for den sags skyld selv blive \u00f8de ogs\u00e5, alts\u00e5 bej han dagen op. Men den gang det blev rigtig lyst, begyndte han lige godt at blive bet\u00e6nkelig. S\u00e5 kom herremanden Hjelmslev ridende forbi og vilde til kirke. Povl gik ud til ham og fortalte ham, hvordan sagerne de stod ang\u00e5endes deher fem. \"Ja, det kan jo godt v\u00e6re, at det ikke er til andet end til at narre os med, men det kan og godt v\u00e6re sandt. Men dersommentid du vil give en god davre, s\u00e5 vil a opholde mig efter dem, og kommer de, skal a nok gj\u00f8re ligen for dem.\" Se, nu skulde de jo rette an for herremanden, der var s\u00e5 meget en gr\u00e5dig \u00e6der, og de fik travlt med at gj\u00f8re store anstalter. En fl\u00e6skebov var alt hvad fl\u00e6sk de havde i huset, og s\u00e5 fik han \u00e6g dertil, og han \u00e5d det altsammen. Allerbedst som de sad, midt i m\u00e5ltidet, s\u00e5 ringede Dover klokke sidste gang, og det f\u00f8rste den var f\u00e6rdig, s\u00e5 begyndte r\u00f6verne at dundre p\u00e5 d\u00f6ren. S\u00e5 siger herremanden: \"Det er sv\u00e6rt, s\u00e5 j\u00f6ver de er, sig til dem, te jeg er ikke rigtig f\u00e6rdig.\" Povl talte ogs\u00e5 til dem, men det agtede de kun lidt om. \"Ja, s\u00e6t nu lidt for d\u00f6ren, for jeg vil miss\u00e6l v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdig.\" Nu bumrede de jo p\u00e5, men det var en lilleagtig d\u00f6r, og de kunde ikke ret komme til, og han sagde, at dersom de nu vilde t\u00f8ve lidt, s\u00e5 skulde han frivillig lukke op. De gav dem da ogs\u00e5 tilfreds den stund. Omsiger var han f\u00e6rdig og rejste sig op fra bordet, tog sin sabel og sagde til Povl, at nu m\u00e5tte han lukke op, men der m\u00e5tte ikke svar velkomme uden \u00e9n ad gangen. Povl gjorde det s\u00e5dan, at der heller ikke kom uden \u00e9n, og s\u00e5 stod herremanden inden for og hug hovedet af dem, som de kom, og sparkede kroppen til side. De fik ingen mistanke, omendskj\u00f6ndt de nok tykte, det bundtede noget med det, men de kunde heller ikke komme af sted med at advare hinanden, n\u00e5r de forst var kommen indenfor, for s\u00e5 var de kaput med det samme. Da den sidste vor sl\u00e5et ihjel, sagde herremanden: \"Nu har jeg gjort ligen for min davre.\" Fra den tid af kaldes kirken Dover kirke, og stedet, hvor r\u00f6verne dr\u00e6btes, kaldtes Hjelmslev-jorden.

The new farm building would then be given new stucco walls as most farms at the time were half-timber construction. The result of this physical removal of buildings from the villages onto the fields was the wide dispersal of farms across the landscape. Farms that had once nestled up to each other cheek-by-jowl in earlier villages could end up quite a distance from each other. Peder also draws attention to the difference in the quality of the land attached to these newly created farms, and it is this disparity in distribution that informs this story. \n\n     The financial difficulties of the farmer at Hell resonate with those confronting the farmer Klaus in the previous story (PJ 1.01). But where Klaus in that story had brought calamity on himself--and therefore deserved to be punished--the farmer at Hell was the victim of the capriciousness of the partitioning system and the forces of the newly emerging free market system.\n\n     The story balances precariously on the border between tall tale and legend. This type of generic fence sitting is a characteristic of Peder's storytelling. The hiring of the farmhand on the way to market is a narrative cue that aligns the story with the folk tale. Although the commerce laws forbade making deals on the way to or from market towns, the negotiation here for the services of a hired hand possibly fell outside the parameters of that law (Tangherlini 2012). \n\n     The agreement that the farmhand would take over the farm once the farmer was too old to continue was a standard agreement, usually between a  farmer or cotter and his children: a child would take over the farm in exchange for continued lodging and a specified amount of foodstuffs for the parent once the parent had gotten too old to continue farming. This system was known as aft\u00e6gt. The unusual aspect to the agreement made in this story is that it is made outside of the family with a virtual stranger. The farmhand's later actions suggest that even this agreement may be part of his larger confidence game. As such, the farmhand's actions align well with those of untrustworthy wanderers. \n\n     The farmhand's solution to the problems at Hell are at first clever, and later downright criminal. The first con that the farmhand undertakes is an elaborate switch at the mill. The switch is rather complicated, and relies on an understanding of local milling practice. The farmhand can only get this information by befriending and ultimately bribing the journeyman miller. Peder's own work as a journeyman miller doubtlessly informs this part of the story. The implication is, of course, that the miller is not beyond reproach. In the story, Peder endorses the actions of the farmhand, since he succeeds (with the help of the miller), to cheat another farmer out of his grain. Endorsing a strategy that puts personal gain first, rather than communal protection, is unusual. \n\n     The second part of the story focuses on the poor relationship between the two preposterously named farms. The farmhand's actions are extreme in every thing he does: his theft from the mill, his deceit of the neighbors, his murder of the old woman, his multiple thefts from the farm at \"Heaven,\" his subsequent cons concerning the conjuring of the woman's spirit, and his multiple manipulations to get people to pay compensation to him for her death. Indeed, his actions align him more with a particularly malicious household spirit or perhaps with the devil than an ambitious or entrepreneurial farmhand. This identification of the farmhand as the devil might help explain the names of the two farms.\n\n     The appearance of a peddler in the final episode of the story aligns well with other stories Peder tells in which these wanderers figure prominently. The final conjuring is clearly unsuccessful since the ghost of the murdered woman continues to haunt.\n\n     The story is reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"Lille Claus og store Claus\" (1835). The story was widely known throughout Scandinavia, and is classified as ATU 1535, \"The Rich and the Poor Farmer.\" \n\n     The reference to \"specier\" as the unit of money points to a time prior to the monetary reform of 1873 (Hvidt 1990, 250-252). For a discussion of the monetary systems in Denmark during the nineteenth century, see the annotation for BJK 3.40.\n\n     Peder only told two stories in his first session with Tang Kristensen, although they were both quite long. According to Minder og Oplevelser, this first session was split over two evenings in the mill, and so it is likely that each of these stories was told on subsequent nights. \n\n      This story is cataloged in the fair copy collection of fairy tales as \u00c6v 1295 and can be compared with a story in the first published volume of \u00c6ventyr fra Jylland (JFm V 49).", "danish_manuscript": "Der vesten for Svejstrup der ligger Siem og\ni den \u00f8stre Kant af S. ligger den Grd som\nkaldes Brandstup. grd og s. langt som Mands\nMinde gaar har det v\u00e6ret et Ensted Sted og\nbebygget.

Af den\ngrund n\u00e6vntes Stederne H\u00e6llede og Hun-\nnerig. En aften omkr. ved Novembers \ntide da sad M. i H\u00e6ll. der og snakk. med\nhans Kone om, at de kunde ikke svare hvad\nde skulde og blev n\u00f8dt til at opgive det der\nsom der blev ikke andre Raad. S. gav hu\nham det Raad at ha skulde se at faa sig\nen st\u00e6rk Karl og arbejde lidt paa Jorden s.\nmaatte de nok kunde faa Foden ud af\nsaadan en Mark og h. befandt at Raadet\nvar godt og gik til Ry Marked for der var\nFolkemarked dg. Da h. kommer herned til\nGlentholm, dg kaldtes det Ry M\u00f8lle s. kom-\nmer h. i F\u00f8lge med en stor Karl og gaar og\nsn. med hinanden og s. viste det sig at\nde gik efter det samme og kommer til Rette\npaa halvvejs og gik hjem igien. L\u00f8nnen blev\nsaadan at K. skulde faa for hvad M. kunde\ngive, og siden naar M. faldt fra skulde h.\nhave St\u00f8tterue (s: Ejendommen). De kommer\nhjem til Konen og M. fort\u00e6ll. hende: Der\ner nu Karlen. Ha h. er lidt storagtig, men\nvi faa vel F\u00f8den. S. s. K. Ja det ser jo\nsmaat ud ved jer, men det kan vel bedres\nHar i noget Kj\u00f8ret\u00f8j. Ja vi har s. M. vi\n\n3755B\nhar et Par Stude og s. en Vogn. Har I ogsaa\nnogle tomme S\u00e6kke.

H. var s. godt om\nsig te h. faar en godt Korn og s. kj\u00f8rer h.\nhjem.

Da vil du da vel ikke\ntil at br\u00e6kke Kisten. Det gj\u00f8r ingen Ting\nvi kan lukke den lige saa godt igien. Ruk-\nker op, og der sidder dh gl.

Men hvad skal vi nu\ngj\u00f8re, naar det bliver opdaget. Jamen\ndet bliver aldrig opdaget, for nu skal I se,\nog tog en af de st\u00f8rste P\u00f8lser og putter i Mun-\nden af hende, s. den kunde hverken kom\n\n3757A\nfrem eller tilbage, s. lukte h. Kist. ganske\nforsigtig til igien, og s. lod de hende staa.\nM. paa Him kj\u00f8rte jo ned og hentede hende\nda Dagen var om, og h. kunde ikke vel\nkom fra Stedet inden h. begyndte at\nsnakke til hende, men hu vilde jo ikke\nsvare. S. t\u00e6nkte h. Da skal a se om a \nkan ikke faa Liv i hende. Kj\u00f8rt af en\nStendynge og paa en anden. Men lige me-\nget hjalp det, ikke s. meget som et Kvab\nhu sagde. N. hvordan har min Moder\ndet s. s. Ko da h. kom ind i Grden. Ja\nnu kan du jo sp\u00f8rge hende om det, for\na er miss\u00e6l kyv opo et. N. det er du,\nja lad os s. faa hende af for hun kan ogsaa\nv\u00e6re kyv opo at ligge i den Kiste, og de\nfaa hende jo l\u00e6st af, og ind og lukt op\nJa der har vi det, s. Ko, a har tit og man\nge G. advaret hende det gl. Skind, for hun\nhar aldrig rigtig forstaaet at passe Munden\nog nu er det lige vel gaaet hen og gaaet\nhende over. De tog og lagde hende paa\nstraa og beg. at spekulere paa at danne\ntil Begr. der var jo ikke andet at se ef\nter. Fik sp\u00e6ndt for og kj\u00f8rte til M\u00f8lle\nDet f\u00f8rste de kom hjem, gav de dem til \nat brygge for at have nogle Gj\u00e6r til\n\n3757B\nBr\u00f8det. S. sidder de om Aftenen og danner\nSkeer der nede i H\u00e6ll. for de var n\u00f8dt til\nat tage Tiden i Betragten. S. s. ha de har\nlavet noget godt \u00d8l oppe i Him. i dag\nJa det har de, s. M. hvem der havde\nhaft sig en Drik af det. Ja det kan vi\nsagt faa, mente Karlen og de to Karle de\nsnakkes ved s. l\u00e6nge til de kommer til Ret\nte om at hente \u00d8llet. Karlen sp\u00e6ndte\nStud. for og de faar en tom T\u00f8nde i Vog\nog rumler op der i N\u00e6rheden og mens\nM. holdt ved Stud. da bar Karl \u00d8llet\nud i T\u00f8nde s. l\u00e6nge til der var kun en\nbitte Slat i Bunden, den lod h. staa og\nsatte Karret paa Kant og M. kj\u00f8rer hjem\nselv gik h. ind og tog den gl. Mad. der\nlaa paa Straa og satte hende paa Hovedet\nind i den Smule der var tilbage. Om\nMorg. det f\u00f8rste M. vaagnede raaber h.\nad hans Kone og s. Aa h\u00f8r ved du hvad\nl\u00f8b ud og hent mig en Taar af det nye \u00d8l\na er da s. knust\u00f8rstig, det var jo en L\u00e6k\nkermund. Hu gaar ogsaa derud, og fandt\nKarret, og der var noget koldt der laa\nderinde, men hu vidste ikke hvad det\nvar. Fulgtes begge ad der ud med Lyset og\nkunde se hvad det var. Naada, da\n\n3758A\nhar hu drukken godt, hu har her drukket\nalt \u00d8llet, men vi maa jo helst s\u00f8rge for\nat faa bagt, da vi har stilt an. Ja det\nmaa vi helst, og de bager s. den Dag og\nfaar Br\u00f8den af Ovnen og faar sat i Bag-\ntruget paa Enden som Skik og Brug er. \nS. gik de til Sengs der oppe, men dem\nder nede i H\u00e6ll. gj\u00f8r ikke. De hentede\njo Br\u00f8den og dragede hjem med det og s.\nlagde de den gl. langs hen ad Truget,\nmen f\u00f8rst tog de en Skalk og over tyggede\nden lidt saadan at de kunde bedre komme\ni Tanker om, at det var hende der havde\nspist Br. og anden Dags Morgen s. M.\nda h. nu ser hvordan Sagerne staar.\nI Dag vil vi ikke brygge for ovenpaa saadan\net Maaltid kan hun miss\u00e6l gj\u00e6rne tr\u00e6n\nge til noget at drikke. Men [I] i morgen\nvil vi have Studen slagtet, for vi vil\nlige godt se om hu i Nat kan gaa ud\nog \u00e6de en levende Stud. Kan hun gj\u00f8re det\ns. skal der andre Kneb til. Hen ved Aftens\ntid da gik Ma, ned til H\u00e6ll. og faar Lov\nopaa M. der at Ka maatte kom op\nog holde ved Studen 2 Dags Morgen og\ns. blev Aftalen at ha skulde m\u00f8de om Morg\n\n3758B\nKl. 6 og det var omkring ved Jul, s det\nvar jo tidlig.

Husk\npaa te det er tredje G. og ha var lide\novertroisk. Ja du ved nok, s. Ka. te\nalle gode Gange det er tre, og s. var der jo\nikke noget at sige, de fulgtes ad op efter\nStuden, fik den lykkelig og vel ud af N\u00f8d\nset og hjem og slagtet med det samme. S. var\nder ikke mere ved det. Ka tog Halen,\nskar den af og gik op til Him. med og s.\ngik han ind og hentede Kon. og lagde hende \ni Studens Baas men hendes Bent\u00f8j \ndet lagde han i Klaven og hendes Hoved\nvendte h. ind mod Grevningen og s. stop\npede h. Halen i Munden af hende og\ndermed gik h. hjem. Om Morg. Kl. 6 som\nder var befalet s. stilte h. oppe ved Gaar\nden igien. S. kalder h paa M. de var\nikke komme op. Jaja s. M. kom indenfor\nvi kan faa os en Bid Br\u00f8d. H. kommer \njo ogsaa ind. Ja nu skal du ikke skaane\nved s. M. at tage for dig af Retterne\n\n3759A\nfor du kan tro du vil faa dine Kr\u00e6fter\nn\u00f8dig og Ka lod sig det ikke sige to gange\nh. tog for sig af Maden. Da de var f\u00e6r-\ndig gik de ud i N\u00f8dset og havde Lygten\nmed. Ja den staar enlig i sin Baas, den\ner nem at kjende, den er lige her ved Siden\naf D\u00f8ren. Ja a kan ingen Stud se s.

Ma lad mig\nkom til med Lygten: I kan jo ingen Ting\nse, og da h. kommer og ser, da havde h. n\u00e6r\nsmidt Lygten af en Forskr. for der laa\nKonen og havde gjort af med Studen s.\nn\u00e6r som den lille Stump Hale, den kunde\nhun ikke have med at skaffee. Ja s....! [K M]\nnaar du har set s. meget s. kan a lige\ns. godt fort\u00e6lle det hele og s. fortalte h.\nhvordan det hele var gaaet til fra det\nf\u00f8rste og til det sidste. Kan du nu sige\nmig et Raad s. h. til Ka hvordan vi skal\nblive hende ledig. Ja a ved jo et Raad s.\nK. men det er jo lidt dyr og det er hu skal\nmanes, der er ikke andet at gj\u00f8re ved hende.\nJa hvem kan gj\u00f8re det. Ja a kan sige dig\nen og det er ingen andre end mig selv, a kan\ngj\u00f8re det, og vil ogsaa da, men a vil have\n\n3759B\ndet godt betalt, for mislykkes det, s. er\ndet mig det kommer til at gaa ud over. Men\nvil du give mig 25 Spesier, s. vil a gj\u00f8re\ndet. Ja det er jo mange Penge s. M. men\nn\u00e6renstid hu s. skal ikke komme igien,\nvil a ogsaa indgaa paa det. Ja, s.

VI har jo ikke andet end\nStude og det skulde helst have v\u00e6ret B\u00e6st\nJo det vil a s. meget gj\u00e6rne s. M. Jaja\ns. skal hu vaskes ren over hele hendes\nKrop og hu skal i rent Linned, og s. skal\nhu i hendes Altarskl\u00e6der og s. skal hu\nkl\u00e6des paa med Kl\u00e6der og Kaabe, ligesom\nhun ellers blev kl\u00e6dt paa i levende Live\nn\u00e6renstid det var koldt og s. er der kun\ndet tilbage.

Ja n\u00e6renstid\nder er ikke andet end det, det kan vi sagt\noverholde og gaa med paa allesammen. \nS. fik Ka. hende i hendes fulde Stads og\ns. kj\u00f8rte h. med hende. Nu var det faldt\n\n3760A\nned med Frostvejr og s. mente Ka. hu kun\nde nok blive ved at holde sig lidt og ha kj\u00f8\nrer til Aarhus med hende og det f\u00f8rste\nh. kommer derind s. kj\u00f8rer h. hen for en\nSkomager D\u00f8r og holder der. S. gaar h. ind \nog s. H\u00f8r her Skom. a har en gl.

Det har a jo nok\ns. h. men a skulde helst vide hvor stor\nFoden var. Ja det kan du gaa ud og snak\nke med hende om, men du kommer til at\nsnakke lidt h\u00f8jt, for hun er lidt tung-\nh\u00f8rende. Skom. gik ud til hende og siger\nom hu vil ikke fly ham Foden han kan\nse hvor stor den er. Men hu svarte ikke\nS. bliver h. hidsig, s. l\u00e6nge staar h. og\npr\u00e6ker med hende og vipper hende over i \nnoget Skramleri ha havde bag i Vog, for\nhun var jo lidt stiv, da h. griber i Foden\nNej holdt s. h. det gj\u00f8r Ka, a vil nok\nhave St\u00f8vler til hende, men have Hovedet\nslaaet i Stykk. af hende det bryder a mig\nikke om.

S. sn. de\nsamme og det blev saadan at Skom. skulde\ngive 25 Sp. og s. skulde Karlen kj\u00f8re. S. \nkj\u00f8rte h. ogsaa ud af Byen. Nu maa a\nvel egentlig helst se at kom hjem, for\nhvem kan vide, om det ikke kunde blive op\nlyst. S. tog Karlen Vejen om ad H\u00f8ve\nog efter Vissing og i de Dage var der Kroer\nsom den er endnu, men den Kromand var\nbekjendt for at v\u00e6re saadan et knurendis\nhidsigt Mske.

Det er hverken\nhun eller mig godt tjent med, her ligger hun\nnu og h. begynder [at] at fl\u00e6tte til Side ved\nAnsigtet af hende, og det viste sig at h.\nhavde ramt hende med Kruset lige midt\ni Panden, der var bleven et stort blaat\nSted. Da Krm. fik det at se, s. blev h.\nlidt lavm\u00e6let. S. s. h. det havde a lige godt\nikke troet, te a havde slaaet s. haardt til\nfor det ser jo ud som hu er d\u00f8d. Ja, det er\nhun, men [d] du vilde vel nok [gron] v\u00e6re\ns. god og sige mig hvor det n\u00e6reste Tingsted\ndet er.

Hvor stor den B\u00f8de blev\nvar der ingen der fik at vide, for det var en\nvelhavende Mand, men den blev vel noget\nstor, og s. kj\u00f8rte h. v\u00e6k.

North of it, about half way between Brandstrup and Hvidsminde there was another farm and the farm was well off since the earth there was so much better and at the other place, there was poverty and nothing else. Because of that, the places were called Hell and Heaven. One evening, around November, the farmer in Hell sat and talked to his wife and said they couldn't pay what they owed and they'd be forced to give up the farm unless they figured something out. She told him that he should find a good strong farmhand and work the land a little, then they should be able to get food from such a field and he thought the advice was sound and he went to Ry market, since in those days there was a general market there. When he gets down here to Glentholm, they called it Ry Mill in those days, he catches up with a big farmhand, and they start talking together and it turned out that they were headed to find the same thing and they reach an agreement about half the way there and they went back home. The farmhand was to get what the farmer could afford in payment, and when the farmer later gave up, he was to get the property. They come home to the wife and the farmer tells her: Here's the farmhand. He's a little bit big, but we'll probably get food. Then the farmhand says, well it looks pretty meager here, but it can probably be made better. Do you have anything to drive with? Yes, we do, said the farmer, we have a pair of oxen, and a wagon. Do you have any empty sacks. Yes, we have so many that we can easily drive to the mill for the sacks' sake, but we have to stay away, since we don't have any grain. Well, just give me the sacks, said the farmhand, and he got them and then he drove out into a pit and filled them with sand, two measures in some and four in others, depending on whether it was to be for flour or meal or bread. Drives off to the mill. It isn't like now, you unhitched the horses and carried your sacks in and then you had to watch out, when the one in front of you had finished milling, you were to step up, otherwise you wouldn't get your grain milled that day. That's how it went then. The farmhand goes and complains, says he's taking too long and they're milling the grain of the one who'd come after him. Goes over to the master journeyman and complains to him, if he couldn't give him advice for this. Well, said the master journeyman, I don't have any advice for that, you'll have to wait to tomorrow or very late tonight until we're finished. Yes, but I absolutely have to get home, and he slips the journeyman a mark. Sure, well now I'll tell you, keep an eye out, when someone comes and is to have a sack taken away, you should come up first and take it away and put your own sack in its place, each person was supposed to take their own sacks away. He was so good at it, that he got some good grain and then he drives home. Then they got some baked bread since they baked so many loaves up in Heaven, they'd get a new loaf from them, otherwise they weren't in such bad shape. They had an old woman up there in that farm and she was so incredibly nosy and asked about the new farmhand they'd gotten and the wife was quite tired of that and complained about it when she got home. Yes, said the farmhand, wait just a little while, then she'll have more to think about. Now, you can go up and borrow their measure. So she did that and brought it home the next day. The old woman grabbed hold of the measure and inspected it and there was a L\u00fcbeck coin stuck in between the ribs down in the bottom and he'd put it there on purpose. No, lookie here, said the old woman, now I can certainly say what they've used this measure for, they've been measuring money with it. She gets so curious about this that she gets her husband to go down there and get permission to store a chest in there and she wants to be in it herself. He goes down there and greets them. Good evening. The farmhand isn't home. Listen, I have a storage chest I want to keep down here. There's linen in it and we're going to have guests. I don't want to put it out in the barn. The bugs could spoil the linen. And it wouldn't be so good to have it out in the moist air. Sure, both he and his house were at his service. The next morning. The chest is driven down there, unloaded and placed next to the wood-burning stove. Around noon, the farmhand comes back from the woods and sees the chest. Hunh, what's this? They tell him. There's something else in there. You aren't going to break the chest open. It wouldn't matter, we can always close it up well again. Breaks it open and the old witch is sitting there and she throws a couple of playing pieces at them and they were quite big. That's quite a game, now I'll see if I can't satisfy her curiosity. He takes his hatchet and hits her in the forehead with it. She couldn't handle that and she dies. Well, well, you're quite a young man, doing that to an old person. What are we going to do now, when they find out. Well, it will never be discovered, now you'll see and he took one of the biggest sausages and puts it in her mouth, it couldn't budge either forward or backward, and then they let her be. The man from Heaven drove down and picked her up at the end of the day, and he hadn't gotten too far from the place when he began to talk to her. But she wouldn't answer. Then he thought, well I'll see if I can't liven her up. Drove down one rock pile and over another. But nothing helped, she didn't say a peep. Well, how is my mother, said his wife when he came to the farm. Well, you can ask her yourself, since I can't get a word out of her. Pretty darn sick of it. Oh, you are are you? Well let's get her down, because she might be sick of lying in that chest herself, and they unloaded her and brought her in and opened it up. Well there you have it. I often warned her, that old bag, that she should watch her mouth, and now its gone and done her in. They took her and lay her on straw and began thinking about her funeral, there was nothing else they could do. They hitched up the horses and drove to the mill. As soon as they got home, they began to brew so they could have some yeast for the bread. At night they sit down there in Hell making spoons, since they had to make use of all their time. Then he said, they've made some good beer up in Heaven today. Yes, they have, says the husband, who'd had a taste of it. Well, we can get it, said the farmhand, and those two guys talk about it for a while and they decide to go get the beer. The farmhand hitched up the oxen and they put an empty barrel in the wagon and rumble up nearby and while the husband held the oxen, the farmhand carried the beer out to the barrel, until there was only a little puddle left in the bottom, he left that there, and he put the tub up on its side and the man drives home. The farmhand goes in and takes the old woman who is lying on straw and puts her head first into the little bit that was left. The next morning, the first thing the husband does when he wakes up is to call to his wife and say, hey, listen, could you go out and get me a taste of the new beer, I'm so incredibly thirsty, he had a real sweet tooth (l\u00e6kkermund). She goes out there, too, and she finds the tub, and there was something cold lying in there, but she didn't know what it was. They both went out there with a candle and they could see what it was. Well, well, you've drunk well, she's drunk all of the beer, but we better bake, since we've gotten everything ready for that. Yes, we'd better, and then they bake that day, and get the bread out of the oven and they put the loaves on their end in the baking trough as is the custom. Then they went to bed up there, but the one's down in Hell don't. They went and got the bread and went on home with it and then they lay the old one along the trough, but first they took a crust and chewed it a bit, so it'd be more likely they'd think that it was her who'd eaten the bread and then the next morning, the husband said, when he saw how things stood, we aren't going to brew today because on top of a meal like that, she'll probably need something to drink. But tomorrow, we can slaughter the ox, since we can see if she can go out tonight and eat a living ox. If she can do that, then we'll have to do something else. Around evening time, the husband there goes down to Hell and gets permission to have the farmhand come and hold the ox the following morning, and they agree that he is to come up there at six in the morning, it was right about Christmastime, and so that was early. It almost sounded like they were afraid of the ox, they could have easily spared themselves the trouble that they were going to have with him. Oh no, said the husband, it will never work. Remember that this is the third time, and he was a little superstitious. Yes, well you know that all good things happen in threes, said the farmhand, and then there was nothing else to say, and they went up together to the ox, got it happily out of the barn and got it home and slaughtered it immediately. Then there was nothing more to it. The farmhand took the tail, cut it off and went up to Heaven with it, and then he went in and got the woman and put her in the ox's stall, but he put her legs in the ties and he put her head out toward the gutter and then he stuffed the tail into her mouth and then he went home. The next morning at six o'clock as agreed, he was up at the farm again. Then he calls to the husband who hadn't gotten up yet. OK, OK, said the husband, come inside, we can have us a bite of bread. He goes in too. Don't be shy, says the husband, take as much as you'd like since you're going to need all your strength, and the farmhand didn't need to be told twice, he took a lot of food. When they were done, they went out into the barn and had the lamp with them. Yes, it's standing alone in its stall, it's easy to recognize, it's right here by the door. Well, I can't see any ox, says the farmhand. And if it's an ox, then it's certainly one of the small ones. Watch out, says the husband, let me come with the lamp, you can't see anything, and when he comes and sees, he almost dropped the lamp out of fear, because there lay the woman and she'd done away with the ox, except for a little piece of tail, she couldn't finish that. Goddammit! since you've seen this much, I can tell you the whole story, and then he told him how things had gone from the beginning to the end. Can you give me some advice, he says to the farmhand, how can we get rid of her? Well, I know one thing, said the farmhand, but it is a little expensive and it's that she needs to be conjured, there's nothing else to do with her. Well, who can do that. I can give you the name of one who can, and it is no other than myself, I can do it, and I will gladly do it too, but I need to be paid well for it, because if it goes bad, it will be me who suffers. But if you give me 25 spesier, then I'll do it. Well, that's a lot of money, said the husband, but if she won't come again, I'll agree to that. OK, says the farmhand, I'll make no other conditions than you let me go home and get our wagon, since you probably don't want to lend me your wagon. We don't have anything other than oxen, and it really should be horses. Sure, I'll gladly lend you mine, said the husband. OK, well then, she needs to be washed clean over her whole body, and she is to be put in clean linen, and then she should be dressed in her church clothes, and then she is to be dressed in regular clothing with a cape, just like she'd be dressed when she was alive when it was cold outside, and that's all there is left to do. You can't mention her here at the farm for the first three months, because then I can't say what might happen, it might happen that you'd wish her back. Well, as long as there's nothing other than that, we can certainly observe those rules, and go along with all of that. Then the farmhand got her in all her finery and then he drove off with her. Now, frost had set in and the farmhand thought she'd probably keep for a little while and he drives to Aarhus with her, and as soon as he gets there, he drives up to a cobbler's door and he stops there. Then he goes in and says, Listen here, cobbler, I have an old woman sitting out here in a wagon, do you think you might have a pair of boots for her, she can't continue with the ones she has. I probably do, he says, but I probably better know how big her feet are. Well, he could go out and talk to her about that, but you'll have to speak loudly, because she's a little hard of hearing. The cobbler goes out and asks if she couldn't give him her foot, so he can see how big it is. But she didn't answer. Then he gets angry, he's stood there so long, preaching to her and he knocks her over back into some junk he had there in the back of the wagon, because she was a little stiff, when he grabs hold of her foot. Hey, stop, the farmhand says, sure I want boots for her, but to have her head smashed in, I'm not really interested in that. Oh, that damn hag, she can probably take a little push, said the cobbler, he shook her a little, but it turned out she couldn't, because she'd been knocked stone dead. Wait a second, my good man, you're going to court. Oh, no, please don't do that, I have a wife and children, can't we come to an agreement? Then they talked to each other and they agreed that the cobbler would give him 25 specier and then the farmhand would drive off. Then he drove out of the town. Now I'd better see about coming home, since who knows if someone might figure this out. Then the farmhand took the road past H\u00f8ve and past Vissing, and in those days there was an inn as there is now, but the innkeeper then was known for being a really short tempered guy. The farmhand drove over to him and then he went in and said, Listen, can't I get you to go out and give my mother a good glass of something to drink, she probably needs it and it was freezing cold that day. Sure, do you have anything to pay with, asked the man, then I certainly can do it. Yes, here you are, here's some money. When the innkeeper had gotten the money, he hurries. She's a little hard of hearing, so you're going to have to shake her a bit to get her to understand what's going on. He went out to the wagon and spoke to her, but it didn't matter how much he shouted. Wasn't used to dealing with the infirm. Without further ado, he throws the mug and its contents at her head. The blow knocked her over. Oh, said the farmhand, so that's how guests are treated here. Yes, said the innkeeper, that kind of leather, that kind of grease. Neither she nor I is well served by that, now she's lying here and he begins to brush at the side of her face, and it turned out that the mug had hit her right in the middle of the forehead, there was a big black and blue mark there. When the innkeeper saw that, he dropped his voice. Then he said, he didn't think he'd hit her that hard since it looked like she was dead. Yes, she is, and so you'll be good enough to tell me where the closest court is. Oh come on, you needn't take it so hard, we should better see if we can't figure something out. We'll I can't really do that, since they'll get it out of me what I've done with my mother, but if it's so that you can do something, then I'll take a fine for her, and then I'll get out of it as best I can. No one found out how big that fine was, because he was a wealthy man, but it was certainly pretty big, and then he drove off. He drove up along J\u00e6vngyde and over by the town's mill and up to Nygaard Woods and up through H\u00f8ve Hollow. Then when he gets to the mouth of H\u00f8ve Hollow, it was night and the moon was shining so beautifully, and there was a peddler lying there sleeping, and his bag lay beside him. When the farmhand sees this, he thinks to himself: I can do some business here and he takes the bag and pours all of the wares into the wagon and takes the old hag and stuffs her down into the bag instead, with her head up and then he drives carefully away, until he gets out of the woods and then he drove until the reins sang and drove home. Drove up and delivered the horses and thanked them for loaning them to him and asked them to remember what he'd asked them in regards to the woman. Then around seven thirty, he wakes up, the peddler does, and he says to himself, you've certainly slept late Kr\u00e6sten, but you can probably still make it, you can get there by nightfall, he would always sleep at Heaven at night and that's where he was headed. Then he started to put his bag on and he says to himself: boy it seems like this bag has gotten so heavy, but I can certainly drag it up there. Then I'll get a rest and then I can start selling things right away and then the bag will get lighter. Then he wandered off. He was sweating, but finally he gets there and comes in just as they're sitting there eating dinner. Good evening and god bless. Thank you, he said, the husband does. It's Kristen. Yes, it certainly is me and no one else. It's been a while since you've been here. Yes, I'm coming straight from Hamburg. You don't walk that road in two days. Well, sit down here at the table and have a little dinner. Why thank you, he says and they ate and when they were more or less done, he says, it seems there's a person missing. Yes, there is, said the husband, and it was quiet for a little bit. Yes, our old mother, where is she. She's dead, he says, the husband does. Then they were done with dinner and the peddler had put his bag up on the table. Oh dear God, I'd love to see that soul one more time, she was a wonderful woman to talk to, and as he says that, he's untied his bag and the old woman sticks her head out. What's this, says the peddler. God help me that's the old woman, and the whole group was shocked. We've been forbidden to wish her here and then a hobo like this comes and brings us into this trouble. They start arguing, him and the peddler and after a while, the peddler learns most of it, how things had happened and then he got out of there as fast as he could, he didn't want to have anything to do with their problems. The next morning, the husband went down to the farmhand and told him what had happened, and asked nicely if he wouldn't please conjure her again, he didn't know what else to do. OK, said the farmhand, now I'll do it one more time, and she'll certainly stay away, but this time I want 12 specier and I want you to wrap her in a burial cloth, she's not to be in anything else. Then he took a wheelbarrow and drove up there and they put her on it and then he drove her down to Siem D\u00f8jer and conjured her there. But since then, there's been haunting down there.", "danish_publication": "Vesten for Svejstrup ligger Siem By, og i den \u00f8stre Kant af den ligger den Gaard, som kaldes Brandstrup Gaarden. Saa langt som Mands Minde gaar, har det v\u00e6ret et Ensted-Sted og bebygget. Saadan omtrent midt vejs mellem Brandstrup og Hvidsminde laa der ogsaa en Gaard, og der var Velstand til huse, for der var Jorden saa meget bedre, men i Brandstrup-Gaarden var der Armod og ikke andet. Af den Grund n\u00e6vntes Stederne Hellede og Himmerig. En Aften omkring ved Novembers Tide sad Manden i Hellede og Snakkede med hans Kone om, at de ikke kunde Svare, hvad de kunde, og at de blev n\u00f8dt til at opgive det, dersom der ikke blev andet Raad. Saa gav hun ham det Raad, at han skulde se at faa sig en st\u00e6rk Karl, og saa skulde de arbejde dygtig paa Jorden, saa maatte de nok kunne saa F\u00f8den ud af saadan en Mark. Han befandt, at Raadet var godt, og gik saa til Ry Marked, hvor der var Folkemarked den Gang. Da han kommer ned til Glentholm, som den Gang kaldtes Ry M\u00f8lle, saa kom han i F\u00f8lge med en stor Karl, og de gik og snakkede med hinanden. Saa viste det sig, at de gik efter det samme, og kom ogsaa til Rette paa halvvejs. De gik da hjem igjen, og L\u00f8nnen blev saadan, at Karlen skulde gaa for, hvad Manden kunde give, og siden, naar Manden faldt fra, skulde han have St\u00f8tterne (hus og det hele). De kommer hjem til Konen, og Manden siger til hende: \"Der er nu Karlen; ja, han er lidt storagtig, (velvogsen), men vi faar vel F\u00f8den.\" \"Ja, det ser jo smaat ud ved jer,\" siger Karlen, \"men det kan vel bedres. Har I noget Kj\u00f8ret\u00f8j?\" \u2014 \"Ja, vi har,\" siger Manden, \"vi har et Par Stude og saa en Vogn.\" -\"Har I nogle tomme S\u00e6kke?\" \u2014 \"Ja, vi har saa mange, te vi kan kj\u00f8re til M\u00f8lle til Ordentlighed for Posers Skyld. Men vi maa kj\u00f8nt blive derfra, for det vi har ikke Korn.\" \u2014 \"Ja, da lad kuns mig faa Poserne,\" siger Karlen, og saa fik han dem, de havde. Saa kj\u00f8rte han ud i en Sandgrav og fyldte dem med Sand, to Skj\u00e6pper i somme og fire Skj\u00e6pper i somme, eftersom de skulde v\u00e6re til Mel eller Gryn eller Br\u00f8d, og saa kj\u00f8rer han til M\u00f8lle.\nDen Gang var det ikke saadan som nu; da spandt en fra, og hver Mand bar sine Poser ind. Naar han kom ind med dem, skulde han passe paa at holde sig til, og naar den var f\u00e6rdig, der fik malet lige f\u00f8r ham, saa skulde han have sit Korn slaaet paa, ellers fik han ikke malet den Dag. Saadan gik det nu til den Gang. Karlen gaar jo og vr\u00f8vler saa l\u00e6nge, te den n\u00e6ste kommer ind, og de kommer til at male paa hans, der var bag efter. Saa gaar han hen til Mestersvenden og klager hans N\u00f8d til ham, saadan og saadan var det gaaet, om han kunde ikke sige ham noget Raad til det. \"Ja,\" siger Svenden, \"det v\u00e9d a ingen Raad for, du kommer til at vente til i Morgen, eller ogsaa maa du blive her saa langt ud paa Aftenen, til vi bliver f\u00e6rdig.\"\u2014 \"Jammen a skulde absolut hjem,\" og saa putter han en Mark til Svenden. \"Ja, nu skal a sige dig noget. Du kan passe paa, naar der kommer \u00e9n og skal have sin S\u00e6k taget fra, at du kan komme f\u00f8rst og tage fra, og saa kan du s\u00e6tte din egen S\u00e6k i Stedet.\"\nNaa, han var saa godt om sig, te han faar den ene S\u00e6k efter den anden, ene godt Korn, og saa kj\u00f8rer han jo hjem med hele L\u00e6sset. Nu fik de bagt Br\u00f8d, og da de forhen havde laant saa meget Br\u00f8d oppe i Himmerig, skulde de jo have sendt et nyt Br\u00f8d der op til at begynde med. Oppe i den Gaard havde de en gammel Kone, og hun var saa f\u00e6lt nysgjerrig efter at h\u00f8re ud om den nye Karl, de havde faaet.  Konen i Hellede gik selv derop med Br\u00f8det, og hun var n\u00e6rved at blive kjed af den gamles Snak og sagde det ogsaa, den Gang hun kom hjem. Saa siger Karlen: \"Ja, t\u00f8v kuns lidt, hun skal nok faa mere at t\u00e6nke paa. Nu kan du gaa op og laane os deres Skj\u00e6ppe.\" Saa gjorde hun det og bar den hjem Andendagen. Den gamle Kone skulde strags hen og have fat i Skj\u00e6ppen for at se efter, og da var der en Lyb\u00e6kker gaaet fast imellem Staverne nede i Bunden. \"Nej se,\" siger hun den gamle, \"nu kan a missel sige jer, hvad de har brugt skj\u00e6ppen til, for de har maalt Penge med den.\" Men Karlen havde jo sat den fast der med Vilje. Den gamle blev saa nysgjerrig efter at faa at vide, hvordan det forhavde sig med de Penge, te hun omsider faar Manden til at gaa derned og faa Lov til at s\u00e6tte en Kiste, og saa vilde hun selv v\u00e6re i den. Han gaar altsaa derned og hilser Godaften. Karlen var ikke hjemme lige i Tiden. \"H\u00f8r,\" siger Manden, \"a har en Standkiste, a vilde have sat herned, den er fuld af Linned. Vi stal have fremmede, og saa holder vi ikke af at s\u00e6tte den ud i Laden, for Ut\u00f8jet kunde jo gaa hen og spolere Linnedet; tillige med kan den heller ikke godt taale at staa ude i den Fugtighed.\" Jo, siger den fattige Mand, det kunde den godt, baade ham og hans Hus stod til deres Tjeneste. Anden Dags Formiddag blev saa Kisten kj\u00f8rt derned og l\u00e6sset af og sat ved siden af Kakkelovnen.\nSaa om Middagen kommer Karlen fra Skovs og ser den Kiste. Nu havde han jo ikke h\u00f8rt den omtale. \"Hvad, hvordan er den kommen der?\" siger han. Det fort\u00e6ller de. \"Ja, der er andet under det.\"\u2014\"Ja vil du da vel ikke til at br\u00e6kke Kisten.\"\u2014\"Det gj\u00f8r ingen Ting,\" siger han, \"vi kan lukke den lige saa godt igjen.\" Han lukker op, og der sidder denher gamle Hegs og slaar et Par Brikker paa dem saa meget gevaltig store. \"Ja var det dog et sv\u00e6rt spil, da skal a se, om a kan ikke faa hendes Nysgjerrighed tilfredsstillet.\" Han tager saa hans Bind\u00f8gse og slaar hende for Panden med. Det kunde hun lige godt ikke taale og sov hen med det samme. \"Jaja,\" siger Konen, \"du er mins\u00e6l en Karl til at gj\u00f8re det af med gamle Folk. Men hvad skal vi nu gj\u00f8re, naar det bliver opdaget?\"\u2014\"Jammen det bliver aldrig opdaget,\" siger han, \"for nu skal I se.\" Saa tager han en af de st\u00f8rste P\u00f8lser og putter i Munden af hende, saa den hverken kan komme frem eller tilbage. Derefter lukte han Kisten ganske forsigtig til igjen og lod hende staa.\nManden paa Himmerig kj\u00f8rte jo ned og hentede hende, da Dagen var omme, og han kunde ikke vel komme fra Stedet, inden han begyndte at snakke til hende, men hun svarte jo ikke. Saa t\u00e6nkte han: \"Da skal a se, om a kan ikke faa Liv i hende,\" og han kj\u00f8rte af \u00e9n Stendynge og paa en anden. Men lige meget hjalp det, ikke saa meget som et Kvab hun sagde. \"Naa, hvordan har min Moder det?\" siger Konen, da han kom ind i Gaarden. \"Ja, nu kan du jo selv sp\u00f8rge hende om det, for a er missel kyv opaa 'et.\"\u2014\"Naa, det er du, ja lad os saa faa hende af, for hun kan ogsaa v\u00e6re kyv opaa at ligge i den Kiste.\" De faar hende jo l\u00e6sset af og faar Kisten ind og faar den lukket op. \"Ja, der har vi det,\" siger Konen, \"a har tit og mange Gange advaret hende, det gamle Skind, for hun har aldrig rigtig forstaaet at passe Maaden, og nu er det ligevel gaaet hen og gaaet hende over.\" De tog saa og lagde hende paa Straa og begyndte nu at spekulere paa at danne til Begravelse, der var jo ikke andet at se efter. De fik sp\u00e6ndt for og kj\u00f8rte til M\u00f8lle, og det f\u00f8rste de kom hjem, gav de dem til at brygge for at have nogle Gj\u00e6r til Br\u00f8det.\nOm Aftenen sidder de der nede i Hellede og danner Skeer, for de var n\u00f8dt til at tage Tiden i Betragtning. Saa lige med et siger Karlen: \"De har lavet noget godt \u00d8l oppe i Himmerig i Dag.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det har de,\" siger Manden, \"hvem der havde haft sig en Drik af det.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det kan vi sagt faa,\" mente Karlen, og de to Mandfolk snakker ved saa l\u00e6nge, til de kommer til Rette om at hente \u00d8llet. Karlen sp\u00e6nder Studene for, og de faar en tom T\u00f8nde i Vognen og rumler der op i N\u00e6rheden. Mens nu Manden holder ved Studene, da bar Karlen \u00d8llet ud i T\u00f8nden, saa l\u00e6nge til der var kun en bitte Slat i Bunden, den lod han staa, og saa satte han Karret paa Kant. Imens nu Manden kj\u00f8rte hjem med \u00d8llet, gik han selv ind og tog den gamle Madamme, der laa paa Straa, og bar hende ud og satte hende paa hovedet ned i den Smule \u00d8l, der var tilbage. Om Morgenen, det f\u00f8rste Manden vaagnede, raabte han ad hans Kone og sagde: \"Aa h\u00f8r, v\u00e9d du hvad, l\u00f8b ub og hent mig en Taar af det nye \u00d8l, a er da saa knust\u00f8rstig.\" Det var jo en L\u00e6kkermund, kan vi nok forstaa. Hun gik ogsaa derud og fandt Karret, og hun m\u00e6rkede noget koldt, der laa der nede, men vidste ikke, hvad det var, og l\u00f8b saa ind til Manden igjen og fortalte ham det. De fulgtes begge ad derud med Lyset, og saa kunde de jo se, hvad det var. \"Naa da, da har hun drukket godt, hun har drukket alt \u00d8llet. Men vi maa jo helst s\u00f8rge for at faa bagt, da vi har stilt an.\"\u2014\"Ja, det maa vi helst,' og de bager saa den Dag og faar Br\u00f8dene af Ovnen og faar dem sat paa Enden i Bagetruget, som Skik og Brug er.\nSaa gik de til Sengs der oppe, de var jo noget tr\u00e6tte af Dagens Travlhed, men dem der nede i Hellede de gjorde ikke. De hentede Br\u00f8dene og dragede hjem med dem, og faa lagde de den gamle langs hen ad Truget. Men f\u00f8rst tog de en Skalk og overtyggede den lidt, saadan at Folkene bedre kunde komme i Tanker om, at det var hende, der havde spist Br\u00f8dene, og den Skalk laa hun med i H\u00e6nderne. Anden Dags Morgen, da de nu ser, hvordan Sagerne staar, siger Manden: \"I Dag vil vi ikke brygge, for oven paa saadant et Maaltid kan hun missel gj\u00e6rne tr\u00e6nge til noget at drikke, og saa beholder vi jo ikke noget af det. Men i Morgen vil vi have Studen slagtet, for vi vil lige godt se, om hun i Nat kan gaa ud og \u00e6de en levende Stud. Kan hun gj\u00f8re det, saa skal der andre Kneb til.\"\nHen ved Aftenstid da gik Manden ned til Hellede og fik Lov opaa Manden der, at Karlen maatte komme op og holde ved Studen anden Dags Morgen, og saa blev Aftalen, at han skulde m\u00f8de Klokken seks. Det var omkring ved Jul, saa det var jo tidlig, og det var endnu helt m\u00f8rkt; men det var alligevel ikke for tidlig at faa begyndt paa Slagteriet.\nSildig paa Aftenen siger Karlen: \"Det lod til, ligesom de var r\u00e6dde for at miste deres Stud. Vi kunde jo gj\u00e6rne skaane dem for den Ulejlighed, de t\u00e6nker paa at have med den.\" - \"Aanej,\" siger Manden, \"det kan aldrig gaa, husk paa, te de er tredje Gang.\" Det sagde han jo, for det han var lidt overtroisk. \"Ja, du v\u00e9d nok,\" siger Karlen, \"te alle gode Gange det er tre,\" og saa var der jo ikke noget at sige. De fulgtes ad op efter Studen, fik den lykkelig og vel ud af N\u00f8dset og trukken hjem og slagtet med det samme. Saa var det til Side. Bag efter tog Karlen halen, skar den af og gik op til Himmerig med den. Der gik han ind og hentede Konen og lagde hende saa i Studens Baas. Men hendes Bent\u00f8j det lagde han i Klaven, og hendes hoved vendte han ud mod Gr\u00e6vningen. Derefter stoppede han Studehalen i Munden af hende, og saa gik han hjem.\nOm Morgenen Klokken segs, som Aftalen var bleven, stillede han oppe ved Gaarden igjen. De var ikke kommen op, og saa kaldte han paa Manden. \"Jaja,\" siger han henne i Sengen, \"kom inden for, vi kan faa os en Bid Br\u00f8d f\u00f8rst.\" Han kommer jo ogsaa ind. \"Ja, nu skal du ikke skaane ved,\" siger Manden, \"at tage for dig af Retterne, for du kan tro, du vil faa dine Kr\u00e6fter n\u00f8dig. Karlen lod sig det ikke sige to Gange, og tog dygtig for sig af Retterne. Da de var f\u00e6rdige, gik de ud i N\u00f8dset og de havde jo Lygten med. \"Ja, den staar enlig i sin Baas,\" siger Manden, idet de gaar over Gaarden, \"den er nem at finde, og den staar lige her ved Siden af D\u00f8ren.\" Saa lukker de D\u00f8ren op. \"Ja, a kan ingen Stud se,\" siger Karlen. \"Og er det en Stud, saa er det mins\u00e6l en af de smaa da.\" \"Forvar jer,\" siger Manden, \"lad mig komme til med Lygten. I kan jo ingen Ting se.\" Da han nu kommer og faar rigtig set til, da havde han n\u00e6r smidt Lygten af ene Forskr\u00e6kkelse, for der laa den gamle Kone og havde helt gjort det af med Studen, saa n\u00e6r som den lille Stump hale, den kunde hun ikke have med at skaffe. \"Ja,\" siger Manden, \"nu du har set saa meget, saa kan a lige godt fort\u00e6lle det hele,\" og saa fortalte han, hvordan det altsammen var gaaet til lige fra det f\u00f8rste og til det sidste.\n\"Kan du nu sige mig et Raad,\" siger han til Karlen, \"hvordan vi Skal blive hende ledig.\"\u2014\"Ja\u2014, a ved jo \u00e9t Raad,\" siger Karlen, \"men det er lidt dyrt.\" \u2014 \"Og det er?\" \"Ja \u2014 a, hun skal manes, der er ikke andet at gj\u00f8re ved hende.\" \u2014 \"Ja, hvem kan gj\u00f8re det?\" \u2014 \"J\u2014a, a kan sige dig \u00e9n, og det er ingen andre end mig selv, a kan justement gj\u00f8re det og vil ogsaa da, men a vil have det godt betalt, for mislykkes det, saa er det mig, det kommer til at gaa ud over.\" \u2014 \"Ja, hvor meget mener du, du skal have?\" \u2014 \"Aa, vil du give mig 25 Specier, saa vil a gj\u00f8re det.\" \u2014 \"Ja \u2014 a, det er jo mange Penge,\" siger Manden, \"men n\u00e6renstid a kan v\u00e6re forvisset paa, hun skal ikke komme igjen, vil a ogsaa gaa ind paa det.\" \u2014 \"Ja,\" siger Karlen, \"a stiller ikke andre Betingelser, end a kj\u00f8rer hjem efter vort Kj\u00f8ret\u00f8j, for du vil vel ikke laane mig dit. Vi har jo ikke andet end Stude, og det skulde jo rigtig nok helst have v\u00e6ret B\u00e6ster.\" \u2014 \"Jo, det vil a saa meget gj\u00e6rne,\" siger Manden. \"Jaja, saa skal hun vaskes ren over hele hendes Krop, og hun skal i en ren S\u00e6rk, og saa skal vi have hende i hendes Alterskl\u00e6der, for hun stal kl\u00e6des paa baade med Kl\u00e6der og Kaabe, ligesom hun ellers blev kl\u00e6dt paa i levende Live, n\u00e6renstid det var koldt. Saa er der kun det tilbage: De tre f\u00f8rste Maanem\u00e6rker maa I ikke snakke om hende her i Gaarden, for hvis det sker, saa vil a ikke indestaa for F\u00f8lgerne. Det kunde jo ske, I kunde komme til at \u00f8nske hende tilbage, og det blev v\u00e6rst for mig.\" \u2014 \"Ja, n\u00e6renstid der er ikke andet end det,\" siger Manden, \"det kan vi sagt overholde og gaa ind paa alt sammen.\"\nSaa fik Karlen hende i hendes fulde Stads, og derefter kj\u00f8rte han med hende. Nu var det faldt ind med Frostvejr, og han mente nok, hun kunde blive ved at holde sig lidt endnu, saa han kj\u00f8rer til Aarhus med hende. Det f\u00f8rste hun kommer der ind, saa kj\u00f8rer han hen for en Skomagers D\u00f8r og holder der. Saa gaar han ind og siger: \"H\u00f8r, Hr. Skomager, a har en gammel Moder, der sidder her ude i Vognen, du skulde da vel ikke have haft set saadan, te en kunde faa et Par St\u00f8vler til hende, hun kan ikke vel n\u00e6re sig med dem, hun har.\" \u2014 \"Det har jeg jo nok,\" siger Skomageren, \"men jeg skulde helst vide, hvor stor Foden var.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det kan du jo gaa ud og snakke med hende om, men du kommer til at snakke lidt h\u00f8jt, for hun er noget tungh\u00f8rende.\" Skomageren gaar saa ud til hende og siger, om hun vil ikke fly ham hendes Fod, han kan se, hvor stor den er. Men hun svarte ikke. Saa bliver han hidsig, han skal staa der og pr\u00e6ke med hende saa l\u00e6nge, og endelig griber han i Foden. Men hun var jo lidt stiv, og saa Vipper han hende over i noget Skramleri, Karlen havde bag i Vognen. \"Nej holdt,\" siger han, det gj\u00f8r Karlen, \"a vil nok have St\u00f8vler til hende, men have hovedet flaaet i Stykker paa hende, det bryder a mig ikke om.\"\u2014 \"Ak, den lebendige Kj\u00e6lling,\" siger Skomageren, \"hun kan Vel taale et Skrup \u2014 for han rev lidt paa det tyske \u2014; \" men saa viste det sig alligevel, at hun ikke havde kunnet taale det Skrup, for hun var slaaet stend\u00f8d. \"Ja holdt nu, go Karl, nu skal du i Retten.\" Saa begynder Skomageren at klage sig: \"Ak nej, det maa du ikke gj\u00f8re, jeg har baade Kone og B\u00f8rn, kan vi ikke komme til Rette i Mindelighed?\" Saa snakker de sammen, og det blev saadan, at Skomageren skulde give 25 Specier, og saa skulde Karlen frafalde Sagen.\nSaa kj\u00f8rte han ogsaa ud af Byen. \"Nu maa a vel egentlig helst se at komme hjem, for hvem kan vide, om det ikke kunde blive opdaget.\" Han tog saa Vejen om ad H\u00f8ve og efter Vissing, og da der i de Dage var Kroerer, som der er endnu, saa kj\u00f8rte Karlen ind i Kroeret. Nu var den Kromand bekjendt for at v\u00e6re saadan et knusendes hidsigt Menneneske, og saa kommer Karlen ind til ham og siger: \"H\u00f8r, kan a ikke faa dig til at gaa ud og give min Moder et godt Glas Drikkelse, det kan hun tr\u00e6nge til, for det fryser klingrendes haardt i Dag.\" \u2014 \"Ja, har du noget at betale med?\" siger Kromanden, \"saa kan det nok lade sig gj\u00f8re.\" \u2014 \"Jo, v\u00e6rsgo, her er Penge.\" Da Kromanden havde faaet Pengene, saa skyndte han sig jo med Drikkelset. \"Hun er lidt tungh\u00f8rende,\" siger Karlen, \"saa du kommer til at r\u00f8vsle lidt med hende, inden kan hun ikke forstaa, hvad det er.\" Han gaar ud til Vognen og snakker til hende; men alt det han raabte, det hjalp ikke, og da han nu ikke var vant til at f\u00e6rdes med Lempe, saa uden videre giver han hende baade Krus og Indhold lige ind i hovedet. Det Slag det v\u00e6ltede hun for. \"Naa,\" siger han, det gj\u00f8r Karlen, der kommer til i det samme, \"naa, Gj\u00e6sterne de bliver behandlede paa den Maade her.\" \u2014 \"Ja,\" siger Kromanden, \"saadant L\u00e6ber, saadan Sm\u00f8relse.\" \u2014 \"Det er hverken hun eller mig godt tjent med,\" siger Karlen igjen, \"nu ligger hun her.\" Han begynder at fl\u00e6tte til Side ved Ansigtet af hende, og det viste sig da, at Kromanden havde ramt hende med Kruset lige midt i Panden, og der var bleven et stort blaat Sted. Da Kromanden fik det at se, saa blev han dog lidt lavm\u00e6let, og saa siger han: \"Det havde a lige godt ikke troet, te a havde slaaet saa haardt til, for det ser jo ud, som hun er d\u00f8d.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det er hun, men du vilde vel nok v\u00e6re saa god at sige mig, hvor det n\u00e6reste Tingsted det er.\"\u2014 \"Aa, det er ligevalle dog ikke v\u00e6rd at tage det saa haardt, vi maa hellere se, om vi ikke kan komme til ens i Mindelighed.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det er knap nok, a kan det,\" siger Karlen, \"for de vil kanske vide af mig, hvor a har gjort af min Moder. Men er det saadan, det er dig meget om at gj\u00f8re, vil a lige godt tage B\u00f8de for hende, saa kommer a vel ud af Sagerne, som a kan bedst.\" Hvor stor den B\u00f8de blev, var der ingen der fik at vide, for Kromanden var en velhavende Mand, men den blev vel noget stor.\nSaa kj\u00f8rte han v\u00e6k fra Kroen, kj\u00f8rte op ad J\u00e6vngyde og over ved Bjens M\u00f8llevad og derpaa op til Nygaard Skov og op gjennem H\u00f8ve Hule. Se, da han kommer til Munden af Hulen, da var det blevet Aften, og Maanen skinte saa dejlig. Saa ser han, der ligger en Kr\u00e6mmer og sover, og hans S\u00e6k laa ved Siden af ham. Da Karlen faar denne her Kr\u00e6mmer at se, t\u00e6nker han ved sig selv: \"Her kan maaske gj\u00f8res Forretning, og han tager Posen og h\u00e6lder alt Krammet ud i Vognen, men Kj\u00e6llingen tager han og stopper i Posen i Steden, med hovedet op ad. Saa kj\u00f8rer han ganske forsigtig derfra, indtil han kom oven ud af Skoven, og derefter kj\u00f8rte han, te det sang i Toldene, derfra og hjem. Saa kj\u00f8rte han op til Himmerig og leverede B\u00e6sterne af og takkede for Laan, og da han sagde Godnat, bad han dem huske paa, hvad han havde bedt dem med hensyn til Konen.\nHen ad Klokken halv otte saa vaagner han, det gj\u00f8r Kr\u00e6mmeren, og han siger jo til sig selv: \"Du har nok sovet vel l\u00e6nge, Kr\u00e6sten, men det kan nok naaes endnu. Du kan komme der til N\u00e6tterdags, naar du skynder dig.\" Han plejede alle Tider at logere i Himmerig om Natten, og det var altsaa der, han vilde til. Saa begynder han jo at sp\u00e6nde Posen paa. \"A tykkes, den er bleven saa sv\u00e6r, den Pose,\" staar han og siger til sig selv, \"men a kan vel nok drage den endda. Naar a kommer derop, saa faar a at hvile, og der kan a strags begynde at handle, saa sykker det i Posen.\" Han vandrede altsaa af Sted og sl\u00e6bte, saa han kom til at svede ved det; men endelig omsider naaer han dertil, og han kommer ind, ligesom de sidder og spiser N\u00e6tter. \"Godaften og Gudsfred!\" siger han. \"Tak,\" siger han, det gjorde Manden, \"det er jo Kr\u00e6sten.\"\u2014 \"Ja, det er sku saa mig selv og ingen andre.\"\u2014 \"Det er l\u00e6nge siden du har vaaer her nu, Kr\u00e6sten.\" \u2014 \"Ja, a kommer og lige fra Hamborg af, den Vej render en ikke ind i to Dage.\" \u2014 \"Ja, da saa s\u00e6t dig herhen til Bordet og faa lidt til din N\u00e6tter.\"\u2014\"Ja Tak,\" siger han og de spiste. Da de var saa omtrent f\u00e6rdige, siger han: \"A tykkes, a savner et Menneske.\" \u2014 \"Naa, det gj\u00f8r du.\" siger Manden, og det var saadan lidt studs. \"Ja, vor gamle Moder, hvor er hun henne?\" siger Kr\u00e6mmeren igjen,  \"Hun er d\u00f8d,\" siger han, det gj\u00f8r Manden. Saa var de f\u00e6rdige med N\u00e6tteren, og Kr\u00e6sten faar hans Pose sat op paa Bordet i det samme. \"Aa Herre Gud, den Sj\u00e6l,\" siger han, \"da gad a nok set hende endnu en Gang, det var en skj\u00f8n Kvinde at tale med.\" Som han siger det, har han l\u00f8ft op for Posen, og saa stikker Madammen hovedet der ud af. \"Hvad er dether!\" siger Kr\u00e6sten, \"ii, det er jo min S\u00e6l den gamle,\" og der blev jo en Forf\u00e6rdelse over det i hele Forsamlingen. \"Vi er blevne forb\u00f8jen,\" siger Manden, \"at \u00f8nske hende her til, og saadan en Landstryger skal saa komme og f\u00f8re os i det Uf\u00f8re!\" Det kommer til Skj\u00e6ldsmaal imellem ham og Kr\u00e6mmeren, og omsider fik jo Kr\u00e6mmeren Historien at vide, hvordan det var gaaet til. Saa str\u00f8g han derfra, det villeste han havde l\u00e6rt, han vilde ikke have med deres V\u00e6rt at skaffe.\nOm anden Dags Morgen stillede Manden nede ved Karlen og fortalte ham, hvordan det hele var gaaet til, og saa bad han ham nok saa mindelig, om han vilde ikke s\u00e6tte hende hen igjen, hellers vidste han ingen Raad. \"Ja,\" siger han Karlen, \"nu skal a gj\u00f8re det \u00e9n Gang til, og saa skal hun nok blive henne, men den Gang vil a have 12 Specier for det, og saa skal du sv\u00f8be hende i et Jordelagen, hun skal ingen andre Ting v\u00e6re i.\" Karlen tog saa en Skubkarre og kj\u00f8rte derop, og der satte han hende paa den, og saa kj\u00f8rte han hende ned i Siem D\u00f8jer (Dyndhuller) og mante hende der. Men siden den Dag har det ogsaa sp\u00f8gt paa det Sted.\n", "english_publication": "West of Svejstrup is Siem Town, and on the eastern edge of Siem there\u2019s a farm that\u2019s called Brandstrup farm. As long as people can remember it\u2019s been an outlying farm and built up. About halfway between Brandstrup and Hvidsminde there was another farm, and the farm was well off since the earth there was so much better, but at Brandstrup farm there was poverty and nothing else. Because of that, the places were called Hell and Heaven.\n     One evening, around November, the farmer in Hell sat and talked to his wife and said they couldn\u2019t pay what they owed and they\u2019d be forced to give up, unless they figured something out. She told him that he should find a good strong farmhand and work hard on the land, then they should be able to get food from a field such as theirs. He thought the advice was sound and he went to Ry market where, in those days, there was a general market. When he gets down here to Glentholm, they called it Ry Mill in those days, he catches up with a big farmhand, and they went along and talked together. It turned out that they were headed to find the same thing and they reach an agreement about halfway there. They went back home and the pay was going to be that the farmhand was to get what the farmer could afford, and when the farmer later gave up farming, he was to get the property (the house and everything). They come home to the wife and the farmer says to her: \u201cHere\u2019s the farmhand. He\u2019s a little bit big, but we\u2019ll probably get the food.\u201d\n     \u201cThings look pretty meager here,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cbut it can probably be made better. Do you have anything to drive with?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, we do,\u201d says the farmer, \u201cwe have a pair of oxen and a wagon.\u201d\u2014\u201cDo you have any empty sacks?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, we have so many that we can easily drive to the mill for the sacks\u2019 sake. But we have to stay away, since we don\u2019t have any grain.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, just give me the sacks,\u201d says the farmhand, and he got all that they had. Then he drove out into a pit and filled them with sand, two measures in some and four in others, depending on whether they were to be for flour or meal or bread, and then he drives off to the mill.\n     Back then it wasn\u2019t like it is now; back then one unhitched the horses and each man carried his own sacks in. When he came in with them, he had to pay attention, and then when the one right in front of him had finished milling, he had to throw his grain into the hopper, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t get his grain milled that day. That\u2019s how it went back then. The farmhand goes and blabbers for so long that the next one comes in, and the newcomer winds up milling on top of the one who was right in front of the farmhand. Then he goes over to the master journeyman and complains to him, such and such had happened, couldn\u2019t he give him some advice about how to handle the situation. \u201cWell,\u201d says the master journeyman, \u201cI don\u2019t have any advice for that, you\u2019ll have to wait to tomorrow or until we\u2019re finished late tonight.\u201d\u2014\u201cBut I absolutely have to get back home,\u201d and he slips the journeyman a mark. \u201cSure, well now, I\u2019ll tell you something. Keep an eye out, when someone comes and is going to have a sack taken away, you can come up first, take it away and put your own sack in its place.\u201d\n     He was so good at doing that that he got the one sack after another, all of it good grain, and then he drives home with the whole load.\n     Then they baked bread and since they had borrowed so many loaves of bread from Heaven in the past, they sent a new loaf up to them as a start. There was an old woman up there in that farm and she was so incredibly curious about the new farmhand they\u2019d gotten. The wife from Hell went up with the bread herself, and she was getting quite tired of the old woman\u2019s chatting and complained about it when she got home. Then the farmhand says, \u201cWell, wait just a little while, then she\u2019ll have more to think about. Now, you can go up and borrow their measure.\u201d So she did that and then she brought it back the next day. The old woman wanted to get hold of the measure immediately to inspect it, and there was a L\u00fcbeck coin stuck in between the tines down in the bottom. \u201cNo, lookie here,\u201d says the old woman, \u201cnow I sure as heck can say what they\u2019ve used this measure for, they\u2019ve been measuring money with it.\u201d But the farmhand had put it there on purpose. The old woman gets so curious about this money that she eventually gets the husband to go down there and get permission to store a chest in the house down there and she wants to be in it herself.\n     He goes down there and greets them, wishing them a good evening. The farmhand wasn\u2019t home at the moment. \u201cListen,\u201d says the farmer, \u201cI have a storage chest I want to keep down here, it\u2019s full of linen. We\u2019re going to have guests and I don\u2019t want to put it out in the barn, because the bugs could get in there and spoil the linen; and it wouldn\u2019t be so good to have it out in the moist air.\u201d Sure, says the poor man, he could do that, both he and his house were at his service. The next morning the chest is driven down there, unloaded, and placed next to the wood-burning stove.\n     Around noon the farmhand comes back from the woods and sees the chest. He hadn\u2019t heard about this arrangement. \u201cHunh, how did this get here?\u201d he says. They tell him. \u201cWell, there\u2019s something else behind this.\u201d\u2014\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to break the chest open.\u201d\u2014\u201cIt won\u2019t matter,\u201d he says, \u201cwe can always close it up again.\u201d He opens it up and the old witch is sitting there and she throws a couple of really big wooden plates at them. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a rough game, now I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t satisfy her curiosity.\u201d He takes his hatchet and hits her in the forehead with it. She couldn\u2019t quite handle that and she immediately dies. \u201cWell, well,\u201d says the wife, \u201cyou\u2019re quite a young man, killing off an old person. What are we going to do now, when it gets discovered?\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, it will never be discovered,\u201d he says, \u201cnow you\u2019ll see.\u201d Then he takes one of the biggest sausages and shoves it into her mouth, so that it can\u2019t budge either forward or backward. Then he carefully closes the chest again and lets her be.\n     The man from Heaven drove down and picked her up at the end of the day, and he hadn\u2019t gotten too far from the place when he began to talk to her, but she didn\u2019t answer. Then he thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t liven her up a bit,\u201d and he drove down one rock pile and over another. But it didn\u2019t help, she didn\u2019t say as much as a peep. \u201cWell, how is my mother?\u201d said his wife when he came back up to the farm. \u201cWell, you can ask her yourself, since I sure as heck am pretty darn sick of it.\u201d \u201cOh, you are, are you? Well let\u2019s get her down off the wagon, because she might be sick of lying in that chest herself.\u201d They unloaded her and brought her in and opened it up. \u201cWell there you have it,\u201d says the wife. \u201cI often warned her, that poor old thing, that she should eat in moderation, and now it\u2019s gone and done her in.\u201d They took her and lay her on straw and began thinking about her funeral, there was nothing else they could do. They hitched up the horses and drove to the mill and as soon as they got home, they began to brew so they could have some yeast for the bread. \n     At night they sit down there in Hell making spoons, since they had to make use of all their time. Then all of a sudden, the farmhand says: \u201cThey\u2019ve made some good beer up in Heaven today.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, they have,\u201d says the husband, \u201ceveryone who has had a taste of it says that.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, we can certainly get a taste,\u201d says the farmhand, and those two guys talk about it for a while and they decide to go get the beer. The farmhand hitches up the oxen and they put an empty barrel in the wagon and rumble up nearby. While the husband holds the oxen, the farmhand carries out the beer in the barrel, until there was only a little puddle left in the bottom of the brewing tub, he left that there, and then he put the tub up on its side. While the man drives home, the farmhand goes in and takes the old woman who is lying on straw and puts her headfirst into the little bit that was left. The next morning, the first thing the husband [from Heaven] does when he wakes up is to call to his wife and says, \u201cHey, listen, could you go out and get me a taste of the new beer, I\u2019m so incredibly thirsty.\u201d You see he had a real soft spot for treats. She goes out there, too, and she finds the tub, and there was something cold lying in there, but she didn\u2019t know what it was and she ran in and told her husband. They both went out there with a candle and they could see what it was. \u201cWell, well, you\u2019ve drunk well, she\u2019s drunk all the beer. But we better make sure we bake, since we\u2019ve gotten everything ready for that.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, we\u2019d better,\u201d and then they bake that day and get the bread out of the oven and they put the loaves on their ends in the baking trough as is the custom.\n     Then they went to bed up there, they were a bit tired from the busy day, but the ones down in Hell didn\u2019t. They [the man and the farmhand from Hell] went up to Heaven and got the loaves of bread and took them home and they laid the old one out along the baking trough. But first they took a crust of bread and chewed it a bit so it\u2019d be more likely that the ones from Heaven would think that it was she who\u2019d eaten the bread and she lay there with that crust in her hands. The next morning, when they saw how things stood, the husband [from Heaven] says, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to brew today because on top of a meal like that, she\u2019ll probably need something to drink, and then we won\u2019t be able to keep any of it. But tomorrow, we can slaughter the ox, since we can see if she can go out tonight and eat a living ox. If she can do that, then we\u2019ll have to do something else.\u201d\n     Around evening time, the husband there goes down to Hell and gets permission to have the farmhand come and hold the ox the following morning so that they can slaughter it, and they agree that he is to come up there at six in the morning. It was right about Christmastime, and so that was early, and it was completely dark; but it still wasn\u2019t too early to start slaughtering.\n     Late that evening, the farmhand says, \u201cIt almost sounded like they were afraid of losing their ox. We could easily spare them the trouble they think they\u2019re going to have with him.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said the husband, \u201cit will never work, remember that this is the third time.\u201d He said that because he was a little superstitious. \u201cYes, we all probably know,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cthat all good things happen in threes,\u201d and then there was nothing else to say. They went up together to get the ox, got it safely out of the barn, and got it home and slaughtered it immediately. Then that was out of the way. Afterward, the farmhand took the tail, cut it off, and went up to Heaven with it. Then he went in and got the [dead] woman and put her in the ox\u2019s stall. But he put her legs in the ties and he put her head out toward the gutter. Then he stuffed the tail into her mouth and then he went home.\n     The next morning at six o\u2019clock, as was agreed, he was up at the farm again. They hadn\u2019t gotten up yet, so he calls to the husband. \u201cOK, OK,\u201d he says from bed, \u201ccome inside, we can have us a bite of bread first.\u201d He goes in too. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d says the husband, \u201ctake as much as you like since you\u2019re going to need all your strength.\u201d The farmhand didn\u2019t need to be told twice, and he took a lot of food. When they were done, they went out into the barn and had the lamp with them. \u201cYes, it\u2019s standing alone in its stall,\u201d says the man as they are crossing the farmyard, \u201cit\u2019s easy to find, it\u2019s right here by the door.\u201d Then they open the door. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t see any ox,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cand if it\u2019s an ox, then it\u2019s certainly one of the small ones.\u201d\u2014\u201cWatch out,\u201d says the husband, \u201clet me come with the lamp. You can\u2019t see anything.\u201d When he comes and gets a good look, he almost dropped the lamp out of fear, because there lay the old woman and she\u2019d done away with the entire ox, except for a little piece of tail, she couldn\u2019t finish that. \u201cWell,\u201d says the man, \u201csince you\u2019ve seen this much, I might as well tell you the whole story,\u201d and then he told him how things had gone from the beginning to the end.\n     \u201cCan you give me some advice,\u201d he says to the farmhand, \u201chow can we get rid of her?\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, I know one thing,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cbut it is a little expensive.\u201d\u2014\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, uh, she needs to be conjured, there\u2019s nothing else to do with her.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, who can do that?\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, I can tell you about someone who can, and it's no other than myself, I can do it, and I will gladly do it too, but I need to be paid well for it, because if it goes bad, it will be me who suffers.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, how much do you think you want?\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, if you give me twenty-five specier, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d says the husband, \u201cbut if I can be sure that she won\u2019t come again, I\u2019ll agree to that.\u201d\u2014\u201cOK,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cI\u2019ll make no other conditions than you let me go home and get our wagon, since you probably don\u2019t want to lend me your wagon. We don\u2019t have anything other than oxen, and it really should be horses.\u201d\u2014\u201cSure, I\u2019ll gladly lend you mine,\u201d says the husband. \u201cOk, well then she needs to be washed clean over her whole body, and she is to be put in a clean shift, she should be dressed in her church clothes, she is to be dressed in regular clothing with a cape, just like she\u2019d be dressed when she was alive when it was cold outside. Then all that\u2019s left to do is this: for the first three months, you can\u2019t mention her here at the farm, because then I can\u2019t say what the consequences might be. It might happen that you\u2019d wish her back, and that would be the worst outcome for me.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, as long as there\u2019s nothing other than that,\u201d says the man, \u201cwe can certainly observe those rules and go along with all of that.\u201d\n     Then the farmhand got her in all her finery and then he drove off with her. Now, frost had set in and the farmhand thought she\u2019d probably keep for a little while and he drives to \u00c5rhus with her. As soon as he gets there, he drives up to a cobbler\u2019s door and he stops there. Then he goes in and says, \u201cListen here, cobbler, I have an old woman sitting out here in the wagon, do you think you might have a pair of boots for her, she can\u2019t continue with the ones she has.\u201d\u2014\u201cI probably do,\u201d says the cobbler, \u201cbut I probably better know how big her feet are.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, you can go out and talk to her about that, but you\u2019ll have to speak loudly, because she\u2019s a little hard of hearing.\u201d The cobbler goes out and asks if she couldn\u2019t give him her foot, so he can see how big it is. But she didn\u2019t answer. Then he gets angry, he\u2019s stood there so long, preaching to her and finally he grabs her foot. But she was a little stiff, he knocks her over into some junk the farmhand had there in the back of the wagon. \u201cHey, stop,\u201d he says, the farmhand does, \u201csure I want boots for her, but to have her head smashed in, I\u2019m not really interested in that.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, that damn hag,\u201d says the cobbler, \u201cshe can probably take a little push\u201d\u2014he was a bit on the German side, but then it turned out that she couldn\u2019t, because she\u2019d been knocked stone dead. \u201cWait a second, my good man, you\u2019re going to court.\u201d Then the cobbler began to moan, \u201cOh, no, please don\u2019t do that, I have a wife and children, can\u2019t we come to an agreement?\u201d Then they talked to each other and they agreed that the cobbler would give him twenty-five specier and then the farmhand would drop the case.\n     Then he drove out of town. \u201cNow I\u2019d better see about coming home, since who knows if someone might figure this out.\u201d Then he took the road past H\u00f8ve and past Vissing, and in those days there was an inn there as there is now, and so he drove to the inn.\n     Now the innkeeper there was known for being a really short-tempered guy and then the farmhand goes in and says, \u201cListen, can\u2019t I get you to go out and give my mother a good glass of something to drink, she probably needs it, it\u2019s really freezing cold today.\u201d\u2014\u201cSure, do you have anything to pay with?\u201d says the innkeeper, \u201cthen I certainly can do it.\u201d When the innkeeper had gotten the money, he hurried out with the drink. \u201cShe\u2019s a little hard of hearing,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cso you\u2019re going to have to shake her a bit, otherwise she won\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d He goes out to the wagon and speaks to her, but it didn\u2019t matter how much he shouted and since he wasn\u2019t used to dealing with the infirm, without further ado, he throws the mug and its contents at her head. The blow knocked her over. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, the farmhand does, as he shows up at that moment, \u201cso that\u2019s how guests are treated here?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes,\u201d says the innkeeper, \u201cthat kind of leather, that kind of grease.\u201d\u2014\u201cNeither she nor I is well served by that,\u201d says the farmhand again, \u201cnow she\u2019s lying here.\u201d He begins to brush at the side of her face, and it turned out that the mug had hit her right in the middle of the forehead; there was a big black and blue mark there. When the innkeeper saw that, he dropped his voice and then he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d hit her that hard because it looks like she is dead.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, she is, and so you\u2019ll be good enough to tell me where the closest court is.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh come on, you needn\u2019t take it so hard, we should better see if we can\u2019t figure something out.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, I can\u2019t really do that,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cbecause they\u2019ll want to know what I\u2019ve done with my mother. But if it\u2019s so that you can do something, then I\u2019ll take a fine for her, and then I\u2019ll get out of it as best I can.\u201d No one found out how big that fine was, because the innkeeper was a wealthy man, but it was certainly pretty big.\n     Then he drove off from the inn. He drove up along J\u00e6vngyde and over by the town\u2019s mill and up to Nygaard Woods and up through H\u00f8ve Hollow. See, when he gets to the mouth of H\u00f8ve Hollow, it was night and the moon was shining so beautifully. Then he saw a peddler lying there sleeping, and his bag lay beside him. When the farmhand sees this here peddler, he thinks to himself: \u201cMaybe I can do some business here,\u201d and he takes the peddler\u2019s bag and pours all the wares into the wagon, but the old woman he takes and stuffs down into the bag instead, with her head pointing up. Then he drives carefully away, until he gets out of the woods and then he drove home going as fast as he could until the reins sang. Then he drove up to Heaven and delivered the horses and thanked them for loaning them to him and asked them to remember what he\u2019d asked them in regard to the woman.\n     Around seven thirty, he wakes up, the peddler does, and he says to himself: \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly slept late, Kr\u00e6sten, but you can probably still make it. You can get there by nightfall, if you hurry.\u201d He would always sleep at Heaven at night and that\u2019s where he was headed. Then he started to put his bag on. \u201cIt seems like this bag has gotten so heavy,\u201d he stands there and says to himself, \u201cbut I can certainly drag it up there. When I get up there, I\u2019ll get a rest and then I can start selling things right away and then the bag will get lighter.\u201d Then he wandered off lugging the bag, and it was so heavy that he wound up sweating; but finally he gets there and comes in just as they\u2019re sitting there eating dinner. \u201cGood evening and God bless!\u201d he says. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, the husband does, \u201cIt\u2019s Kr\u00e6sten.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, it certainly is me and no one else.\u201d\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been here, Kr\u00e6sten.\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, I\u2019m coming straight from Hamburg, you don\u2019t walk that road in two days.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, sit down here at the table and have a little dinner.\u201d\u2014\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d he says and they ate. When they were more or less done, he says, \u201cI seem to be missing a person.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, you are, are you?\u201d says the husband, and it was quiet for a little bit. \u201cYes, our old mother, where is she?\u201d says the peddler. \u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, the husband does.\n     Then they were done with dinner and the peddler had put his bag up on the table. \u201cOh dear God, that soul,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019d love to see her one more time, she was a wonderful woman to talk to.\u201d As he says that, he\u2019s untied his bag and the old woman sticks her head out. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d says the peddler, \u201cGod help me that\u2019s the old woman,\u201d and the whole group was shocked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been forbidden,\u201d says the man, \u201cto wish her here and then a hobo like this comes and brings us into this trouble.\u201d They start arguing, him and the peddler, and after a while the peddler learns most of the story, how things had happened. Then he got out of there as fast as he could, he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with their problems.\n     The next morning, the husband from Heaven went down to the farmhand at Hell and told him what had happened and asked nicely if he wouldn\u2019t please conjure her again, he didn\u2019t know what else to do. \u201cOK,\u201d says the farmhand, \u201cI\u2019ll do it one more time, and she\u2019ll certainly stay away, but this time I want twelve specier to do it, and I want you to wrap her in a burial cloth, she\u2019s not to be in anything else.\u201d The farmhand then got a wheelbarrow and drove up there and put her on it and then he drove her down to Siem D\u00f8jer [the Siem mudholes] and conjured her there. But since then, there\u2019s been haunting down there."}, {"story_id": 375, "full_name": "123 - 2.01 - DS_IV_720", "publication_info": "DS_IV_720", "annotation": "The manor lord in this story is not only remarkably wealthy, but also unusually cruel and arrogant. He is more than cut down to size by the girl's relatives. Interestingly, the relatives are manor lords themselves and so the loss of the seven manor farms does not result in a redistribution of wealth to poorer layers of society. Instead the redistribution takes place within the same class. Similarly, the young girl is not from the class of his usual victims: the women he sleeps with and throws into the moat are clearly the children of day laborers and other leasehold farmers, and not the children of farm owners or aristocrats. Nevertheless, the cruelty of the manor lord leads to his demise. His sentence to wander about as a beggar calls to mind stories of the Wandering Jew and also acts as a form of narrative justice.\n\n     The dice game appears to be rigged, and thus the punishment of the Count relies on dishonesty. His wrongs are righted by the wrongs of the other manor lords--cruelty and barbarism are counteracted by dishonesty and immorality. Of course, fighting one inversion with another is a successful strategy in folk narrative to deal with outside threat.\n\n     Unlike his previous stories, Peder makes a point of emphasizing the truth of this narrative. \n\n     There is little difference between the manuscript and published version of the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Paa Gaarden Urup var der en Grev J\u00f8rgen, det\nvar en rig M. h. ejede 7 Herregaarde for-\nuden Urup og n\u00e6rensti h. kj\u00f8r i styv Stads\ns. havde h. 8 [for] hvide Hopper for.

The farm was stoutly built, the windowsills were sculpted out of fine stone and there was a drawbridge leading into it from the courtyard and the door posts and the knocker were made out of whalebone. But he was a lecherous fellow, that is to say he stole their girls round about and he had one to lie with every night and afterward he'd throw her into the moat, and then she had to take care of herself, whether she'd make it to land or not. Then he got to thinking that he wanted to get married and he went on down to Venge farm, a rich woman lived there, she only had one daughter. He courted her, and he had his horses shod with gold horse shoes before he rode over there and there was a group of young men who followed along in procession. When he got to the farm, the woman was standing at the gate, so he told her his errand there on his horse. When he was finished, the woman answered: \"No, my daughter is not going to have so lecherous a fellow.\" Then he threatened her but I can't remember what it was since I was only six years old when it was told to me. The woman got out of it by getting five manor lords from her kin go after him, and they cheated him.

Not surprisingly, the people at the farm turn to several local ministers to solve the problem, a fairly standard strategy for dealing with haunts, despite the seeming incongruity of Lutheran ministers dealing with a threat (ghosts) that should have disappeared with the Reformation (Tangherlini 1999). The ministers' failure can be read as a stinging indictment of the power of the minister and, by extension, the Lutheran church. In contrast, the beggar, who has no social standing and whose name, Klemmen Unborn, suggests a supernatural liminality, succeeds. The nickname probably refers to his birth by Caesarian section, an operation that was known as early as the sixteenth century when it was used to deliver children whose mothers had died during childbirth (see KMP 1.05).

Many of these stories tell of women who die undelivered and who subsequently haunt. Often they are solicitous, and ask for clothes for their child (DS V 1158; DS V 1164).\n\n     The incidence of out of wedlock birth in rural Denmark was high, but not overwhelming, and so it is unlikely that many women would see such a birth as a terrible problem. Rather, the problem lies in the adultery committed by the two.\n\n     Revealing the father's identity was a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it would ease the childbirth, but on the other hand, it would lead to censure for her and the feed hand. Despite the girl's fatal attempt at cover-up, her death and haunting acts as en even greater disruptive force than if she had simply named the father. Here the disruption goes beyond the feed hand's immediate family, and threatens the economy of the entire farm. Danish laws required that unwed mothers provide the name of their child's father. Not providing the name was, consequently, illegal.\n\n     Peder clearly endorses the strategy of using the minister to counteract the threat posed by haunts (Tangherlini 1999). Pentik\u00e4inen determined that engaging a solicitous haunt in conversation usually eliminated the haunting (1969).

There are also many stories about churches or church bells that sink to the bottom of lakes as a form of divine punishment for the transgressions of the minister or parishioners (DS III 528, 529, 531, 533). Peder combines both motifs in this account.\n\n     The minister's ungodliness causes the church, perhaps the clearest symbol of the human community, to sink into the water, rendering it useless. That the church is still visible acts as an ongoing reminder to the fate that can befall the ungodly.\n\n     The parishioners' attempt to seize the treasure is also worthy of censure. In stories of the drinking cup stolen from the mound folk, the cup is most often used to build a church, or in some other way figures in the communal treasure kept at the church. The church itself stands as a form of community treasure as it represents the clearest protection against the various threatening supernatural forces that confront the human community. \n\n     The goal of the treasure hunt is personal enrichment, as opposed to the communal enrichment espoused by the drinking cup theft narratives. Not surprisingly, the treasure hunt fails (Lindow 1982). The apparent conflagration engulfing the town that interrupts the erstwhile treasure hunters, a common motif in these stories, is a clear physical representation of the destruction of the community's social structures that would ensue if their treasure hunt were to succeed. \n\n     The treasure hunters' solitary pursuit of wealth contradicts the ideal of community solidarity, yet aligns well with the emerging capitalist economy and incentives for individual success. The \"limited good\" model suggests that any such personal gain would come at the expense of others in the community; the new, capitalist model stressing individual initiative and success proposes an \"unlimited good\" model, where one man's fortune is not necessarily congruent with others' misfortune (Foster 1965).", "danish_manuscript": "Stilling S\u00f8 ligger der Kirke paa Bunden\naf.

Peder includes two widely attested beliefs: first, the belief in the existence of the \"Black School,\" in this case located in Copenhagen (as opposed to the more common location in Wittenberg) (see DS VI 75; DS VI 95) and second, the belief that candles burn for treasure (DS III 2164; DS III 2168). An unusual feature of Peder's story is that the candle burns for everything but treasure. The discussion of the stones with inscriptions on it is reminiscent of Bitte Jens's story of the rune stone found out in a field (BJK 3.03).\n\n     The treasure hunt proceeds in a markedly similar manner to the fishing expedition in the preceding story (PJ 2.09). Here, the disturbance comes from a host of unusual or unexpected animals, another common motif. The farmhand's outburst confirms that the animals are the spawn of Satan. The appearance of an elk further underscores this connection (see KMP 1.36). \n\n     The individual pursuit of wealth, with its implicit disavowal of the community, aligns well with the destructive tendencies of Satan. At the same time, it also aligns well with the newly emergent market economies, where untold wealth could be obtained in one fell swoop (Taussig 1980).", "danish_manuscript": "Der ligger en Kongel\u00f8sning i Silkeborg Skov\nog derover staar en stor Eg, men den er\nsandet til og s. var der en Mand der be-\nkostede en hel Del paa at grave den\nud og de havde kast dem s. langt ned at\nde var kommen til Roden af Egen.

Here, the dance is quite energetic and the mound is raised on four glowing poles, suggesting that the dance takes place at night. The little man keeping watch over the dance wears the typical red stocking hat of the Danish farm worker. The red stocking hat is well-known as part of the standard attire of the farm guardian spirit, the nisse and has also been adopted in contemporary culture for Santa Claus's little helpers.\n\n     After his generalized description of the mound dwellers' dance, Peder relates a more specific legend of kidnapping. Here, the victim is danced to death by the mound folk (see also KMP 1.01, 1.42 and 1.60; AMJ 2.15). Satan also dances people to death, and so an intertextual relationship is established between the mound folk and Satan. The dancing occurs during normal farming activity and the girl has done nothing to bring this upon herself. In other variants, the hired hand seeks out the mound dwellers on his or her own accord. The death of the hired girl clearly threatens to disrupt the functioning of the farm, and has  implications for the physical well-being of the farm workers, the fecundity of the community in the future, and the economic survival of the farm.

In this manner, he signals the importance of the Moss\u00f8 area to the growing sense of Danish nationalism and, through his narrative, vicariously takes part in one of the few successful battles the Danes waged against Prussia.\n\n     In 1888, battles with Prussians were still fresh in the minds of many Danes, and in particular Jutlanders, given the crushing defeat that Denmark suffered at the hands of Bismark's army in 1864, including the slaughter at Dybb\u00f8l (April 18, 1864), and the subsequent loss of Schleswig and Holstein. The political turmoil caused by the ongoing discussion of the Schleswig and Holstein question reverberated for decades in the newly forming Danish state. \n\n     Niels Ebbesen, a hero from the fourteenth century, and the Danish \"victory\" at Isted over the German-backed Schlewsig-Holstein army on July 25, 1850, became narrative touchstones for many Danes who were rightfully worried about the looming threat of Bismarck's Germany to the south. Peder makes the connection between Niels Ebbesen and 1849 explicit in his story, since in 1849 there were over two hundred German soldiers housed at Leg\u00e5rdslyst, a farm to the west of Vrold, and quite close to Fuldbro M\u00f8lle. The skirmish at Fuldbro M\u00f8lle, on the bridge that ran directly in front of where Peder lived, was with German soldiers quartered at Leg\u00e5rdslyst.\n\n     Niels Ebbesen is one of the best known Danish freedom fighters. He fought against Count Gerhad from Holstein in Randers in April 1340, and died in the fort at Skanderborg on the first of November of that same year. Among the earliest descriptions of Niels Ebbesen's deeds in this battle are those in the nearly contemporaneous Jyske Kr\u00f8nike (1342) and the slightly later Sj\u00e6llandske Kr\u00f8nike (1367). Along with various legends, Niels Ebbesen also appears in ballads (see DgF 156). Later references to Niels Ebbesen include a play by Kaj Munk (1944).

Birthing was a dangerous proposition, and the incidence of death in childbirth was high. There are multiple explanations for the nisse's request for help. It is likely that the nisse hopes that the child can become Christian through the intervention of the human midwife, and the subsequent payment that results in the gift to Dover church. It is equally possible that the nisse's wife is a human, kidnapped into the other world. Accordingly, the wife would need a human to help her deliver.\n\n     Peder's story of midwife to the nisse is unusual in that he casts the nisse in the role of supernatural protagonist rather than a mound dweller. Nisser are generally solitary figures and there are few stories in which they have families. John Lindow's analysis of the nisse would preclude a nisse family (Lindow 1975), since his analysis show nisse to be decidedly male and non-fertile.\n\n    The reward offered the woman for her services and her reaction are typical. Things from the other world--food, money, animals--are often not what they appear to be. Here, of course, they are much more valuable than they seem. The stories can be seen as addressing the complexities of low level out group transactions, where the value of goods and services exchanged is hard to calculate (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n    Many variants of this story resolve negatively when the woman discovers that she has thrown away considerable wealth since the one or two shavings remaining in her apron have transformed into gold (DS I 1137). Peder's secondary ending allows for a more positive resolution.\n\n     Peder also adds a short, secondary story, also widely attested, and also usually related to the mound dwellers.

The two thieves start off as Danish Robin-Hoods but quickly degenerate in the narrative into thugs. The thieves encapsulate many of the worries that people had about the large number of poor who wandered the countryside, particularly at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries. These worries undoubtedly influenced the fairly rapid move in the 1860s toward the establishment of poor farms in many Jutlandic districts (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). \n\n      The hunt for the two thieves is helped along by the intervention of a miller. In this manner, Peder injects himself--or at least his representative--into the narrative. The song that is written about Kyvling-S\u00f8ren is also clearly of interest to Peder given his work as a fiddler. Peder is similarly fascinated by the escape tool that the thief hides in his bowels. \n\n     The stocks house (stokhus), named for the whipping stocks on its premises, where Kyvling-S\u00f8ren is incarcerated was one of Denmark's most notorious prisons. Originally a military prison, it was opened to civilian prisoners in 1741. The prisoners were broken into two groups: \"honest\" prisoners and \"dishonest\" prisoners, this latter group being those who had been whipped. Whipping was seen not only as a harsh punishment but also as a loss of honor. The prison was closed in 1860.\n\n     The narrative hovers between fascination with these outlaws, and the celebration of their harsh punishment.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var et Par Kj\u00e6ltringer der huserede en G.\noppe i Ry Skov, de havde deres Tilhold i\nSavkulerne Kyvling S\u00f8ren og s. en de kaldte\nJens Knop.

Rather, the lamb acts as a foundation sacrifice for the building of the church. Such sacrifices were intended to dispel the affects of harmful spirits or haunts. The most extreme form of such sacrifice occurs in stories about the plague. In some of those stories, children are buried at the boundary to the town or in churchyard walls to stop the disease (DS IV 1777). In other variants, the live burial is intended to help reestablish the community, and is not related to disease (DS IV 1787). The ghost of the sacrificed lamb subsequently haunts in the shape of the corpse lamb.

Wages for farmhands and day laborers were very low, largely because of a glut of workers. Many contracts simply offered food, lodging, and a very small stipend paid quarterly or semi annually (Hvidt and Olsen 1990).\n\n     The manor lady's churchgoing is unusual, taking place on a day and at a time not generally associated with churchgoing. Her solitary (rather than communal) use of the church mimics her selfishness and stinginess. It also leaves her wide open to apparent supernatural (Satanic) attack. The farmhand plays on this liminality in his successful attempt to trick her.\n\n     Peder's story is reminiscent of the story of the would-be ghost (ML3005) (Stokker 1992). In those stories, however, the corrective is misguidedly aimed at the minister who turns out to be engaged in the necessary protection of the community from evil, and the farmhand is appropriately--if somewhat harshly--punished.\n\n     Peder tells several stories of farmhands who trick their superiors for their own personal gain (PJ 1.02 and 2.27).

This early transgression enables the rest of the story which relies entirely on the sale of goods that are not even remotely what they appear to be. \n\n    The overtly destructive nature of Jens's tricks resonates with Peder's first story, in which the farmhand kills the grandmother at the neighboring farm (PJ 1.01). The order of the ruses seems a bit confused since it does not progress in a manner of increasing harm. The men's deaths, by contrast, fittingly comes at the end of the story. The seeming disarray in the order of events is underscored by Peder's addition, after the end of the tale, of an episode in which Jens sells the men a fox to stay with their geese.  This addition is noted in expanded form in the fair copy of the tale.\n\n    The Poles alluded to in the story were in Denmark during the war with Sweden, 1657-1659.

J. og rumster lidt ved hende\nJa hun er sku vis over det. Men det er\nder ingen Fare for og h. r\u00e6kker op paa en\nHylder og tager en Fl\u00f8jte der laa og den\ns\u00e6tter h. om i hendes Nakke og giver sig\ntil at bl\u00e6se.

Ja ved du hvad J. naar\n\n3784A\ndu vil give os den Fl\u00f8jte, s. skal det hele\nv\u00e6re glemt med den Hattekom. for den\nFl\u00f8jte kunde de bruge, deres Kvindfolk var\nslem s\u00f8vnige af dem. N. de fik jo Fl.\nog de gik nok s. glad og vel forn\u00f8jet hjem\nS. s. den M. i den vester Gaard, Ja nu vil\na missel pr\u00f8ve Fl. f\u00f8rst, du pr\u00f8vede H.\nf\u00f8rst og dg. er det da ingen Snyderi, for\nKj. hu var d\u00f8d. Og h. sidder jo om 2 Dags\nAft. inde med hans Kvindfolk og venter jo\ns. haardt paa at den ene af dem skulde\nfalde i S\u00f8vn, at ha kunde kom til at \npr\u00f8ve dh. Indretn. Nu var det jo baade\nsaa og da, for det var nogle satans sikre\nKvindfolk, s. hvis de ikke fik det lidt godt\ns. kunde M. risiker at faa det bag efter.\nSkal der slaaes, s. skal der slaaes til, for\nhellers gaar det ikke. S. omsider falder da\nKon. f\u00f8rst i S\u00f8vn og sov baade trygt og fast.\nS. havde h. sat en tyk kj\u00e6p i en Krog til\ndet Brug, den tr\u00e6kker h. frem og s. giver h.\nhende en lige ind i Planeten og hu v\u00e6lter\njo om s. d\u00f8d som en Sild. Men hvad gj\u00f8r\ndu nu, slaar du nu din egen Kone ihjel da\ner du et forvovent Mske. Aa det har\ningen Fare, a skal nok faa hende vaagen,\nI skal ikke klage jer, og h. tager i Fl\u00f8jten\n\n3784B\nog pib i Nak. paa hende, s. Vandet kom ud\naf begge hans \u00d8jne, men lige meget hjalp\ndet. S. s. h. til de andre: Nu maa I ende\nlig tie stille med det, for den 2 skal mis-\nsel pr\u00f8ve det ogsaa, a vil ikke v\u00e6re ene om\nSkaden, og kort at fort. det gik 2 akku-\nrat lige saadan. Nu fik de jo travlt\ni nogle Dage med at faa deres Koner be\ngravet og s. havde J. jo da Fred i den Tid.\nI melder goddag var nogle Tatere dreven om\nkring og havde haft Losi ved Jens og de\nhavde et udenlands Dyr med dem og det\nhavde de ladt blive med J. en Ulv og h.\nvidste aldrig hvad h. skulde gj\u00f8re ved det\nKreatur. S. omsider kommer M. ned til\nham en Dag og beg. at skylde ham for at\nh. havde slaaet deres Koner ihjel og alt\ndeth. S. s. h. til dem. Ja a har jo ingen\nSkyld i det, for I saa jo hvordan a bar\nmig ad, og I har slaaet fejl. Men a har\nfaaet en V\u00e6dder her, den vil a give jer for\nat vi kan blive ved at holde Venskab\nA tykker h. ser mig s. strag ud i Tovet,\ns. den 1 Mand. Ja det er h ogsaa mente J.\nmen det er af en udenlandske Race og h. er\nfrisk og sund og hvor h. kommer i en Flok Faar\nder kommer ingen Sygen imeld Faarene.\n\n3785A\nI de Tider havde de s. ondt ved at holde\nLiv i deres Faar, for der var Sygen imeld\ndem. Og s. er der endelig en Ting til og det\ner det, at h er s. god til at passe paa Lam\nme. R\u00e6vene kan ingen Lam tage. S. tykte\nde endelig ogsaa: Lad os tage ham, noget\ner bedre end intet og V. fik de og tr\u00e6kk. hjem\nmed ham. De havde deres Faarehold neden\nfor Gaardene og det var lagt til med Sne,\ns. de drev alle Faarene ind i en Fold alle-\nsammen, for de drev sam. altid. S. s. de\ntil deres Folk, nu skal I ikke se til dem\nden f\u00f8rste Dags Tid, h. skal have Tid til\nat blive kjendt med dem, ellers vil h.\nrende hen. N. Enden af Visen blev, at\nUlven bed en Del af Faarene ihjel og br\u00e6k\nHul paa Taget og rendte sin Vej og de saa\ningen Ulv siden. S. gik det en lille Tid og \nde grubliserede over det Dyr der havde saa-\ndan \u00f8dt dem deres Faar og omsider kom\nde i Tanker om, at det var ogsaa en Kj\u00e6l-\ntring streg h. havde spillet dem. Men nu \nvar det blevet s. str\u00e6ng Vinter, nu var der\nikke noget at spekul. paa med ham.\nMen J. havde ikke lagt paa den dovne side\ni det Lag, h. havde gaaet ned og kj\u00f8bt sig et\nudgangs\u00f8g, og det havde h. faaet\n\n3785B\nstilt op. S. hen i Foraarstiden kom de ned\ntil ham en Dag og s. hvad er det for et B\u00e6st\ndu har der lagt dig til Jens. Det er et \nB\u00e6st der er stor Fortj. det ser ikke ud til ret\nmeget, men det er godt allig. S. havde h.\nbundet en vendret Kurv for R\u00f8ven af\ndet. Hvad skal det betyde den h\u00e6nger\nder. Aa s. h. det er for ikke at have for\nmeget Ulejlighed med at samle Pengene\nop i Skidtet. Ja, s. skulde de jo hen at\nse i den og der var en Hoben Gj\u00f8dning, men\nogsaa nogle Kobberskj. Hvad, kan det B\ngj\u00f8re Penge. Ja det kan I da vel se. og \ns. med det samme slaar h et godt Slag\nover R. af det og s. trimler der nogle fle\nre ud fra Halen af det. Ja det ser ud\ntil det, s. de, saadan et kunde det nok\nv\u00e6re v\u00e6rd at have. Ja s. J. det er der god\nFortj. ved, men ikke s. meget for mig,\nfor a har jo ikke Raad til at give det\ns. god en F\u00f8de. Jo flere Penge, jo bedre\nF\u00f8de det faar. Ja, Enden paa Visen blev\nda at de fik J. til at overlade dem B\u00e6stet\nog s. tr\u00e6k de jo hjem med det. Den ene af\ndem fik det f\u00f8rst og h. lod det gaa ind i\nen af hans bedste Stuer og h. bar en hel\nDel Havre ind til det og en hel Del S\u00e6nge\n\n3786A\nkl\u00e6der at det skulde ligge godt, for h. men\nte jo at jo bedre den laa jo flere Penge den\nfik. Men det viste sig, at den spolerede\ndem alting og ingen Penge. Den 2 M. fik\ndet at pr\u00f8ve ogsaa; ham gik det ligesaa\ndan. S. s. de til hindanden: Nu skal h. \nl\u00e6gges \u00f8de, ellers l\u00e6gger h. os \u00f8de og s. fulg-\ntes de ad derud og puttede ham i en S\u00e6k\nde havde med dem og det var en S\u00f8ndag\nMorg. S. tykte de nu da det var s. n\u00e6r\nved Kirken, s. vilde de da ind og h\u00f8re Pr\u00e6k.\nog s. lade ham ligge udenfor Kirk.grds-\nmuren i god Rolighed. S. s. h. albedst\nsom h. ligger, Nej a vill ikke til Himmels\nfor aldrig det. Der kommer en gl. M. i\ndet samme. Da vilde a s. m. gj\u00e6rne, dersom\na kunde kom der. Ja da kan du nemt\nkomme der, dersom du vil krybe ind i dh.\nS\u00e6k s. h. Kn. S. maa vi to hellere kom \ntil at bytte.

Da de kom ned\n\n3786B\ntil Ravn S\u00f8. s. smed de ham ud og s. gik\nde hjem. Men undervejs kommer de forbi\nJ. der kommer drivende med et pr\u00e6gtig Hob-\nbel H\u00f8veder, det var af M\u00e6ndenes egne\nder gik l\u00f8se ude i Skoven og der gik han\nog dr\u00f8v med en Hjar af dem.

Then one day when the woman had gone down to weave, she'd made a very nice piece of homespun and then she said to the boy, listen Jens, can't you take this piece of homespun and go to Aarhus with it, there's no use in going to Skanderborg, you won't be able to get rid of it there, and then you can sell it, but you're to get 1 mark for each two foot length. And please let me see that you can do this properly. I certainly will, he says, and he takes the cloth and went off. He went past Hemstok and the Hemstok men are standing outside there talking. Where are you going with that, you're going so fast. Yes, I'm going to Aarhus with this piece of cloth for my mother. Oh, are you now? How much does it cost...1 Mark. Well, then it's not worth your trouble going any farther, we'll take it, you don't have to go to Aarhus for that. The boy was quite happy about that and he gets his Mark and they get the homespun and then he went home to his mother with it. Oh, she said, when she heard how things had gone, that's how you handled yourself, little Jens. I doubted it. Then there's nothing else to do, since if I know those Hemstok men, they'll hold on to what they've got. Then a day later, she'd been out churning. Listen, here's some butter and some buttermilk, they better be in the churn together and you'd better put it on your back. But you aren't to go that way, you're to go over to the Poles, it was in the days when they were here and they had their stalls in a town named Boes, and that's how it got its name. They could see over the entire area, and nobody could come at them from one side, and the other sides were flooded with water, and it lay quite high. But they needed something to live off, and the woman counted on that. But let me see that they don't trick you, little Jens. No. This time they won't trick me any more than this here piece of straw, the boy said and then he bends over and was going to pick up a piece of straw, but isn't careful and the butter and milk spill over his head. Oh, it's a real shame, says the mother, with such a fathead. Yeah, yeah, said the boy, you're also so hot-headed. But give me a moment to think, I'll certainly trick them up there. Then Jens went and thought for several days and he made sure he got a piece of canvas she gave him one market day and he went to Skanderborg with it. He made sure that these Hemstok men were there and had seen him. Jens sells his canvas and gets a few coins in his pocket and then he goes in to three different inns and tells them a bit about how things stand, and how he wants to pay the two men back. Then he goes out again and finds these two men, and invites them in for a drink, and they thought, it isn't worth spending your money on us Jens. Well, I could certainly deal with you another time and he puffed himself up a bit. Sure, sure, said the first man, let's go. Waiter, give us a mug of Polak, that was a common drink in those days, it was half beer and half mead. The waiter brings it over immediately and when they were done, Jens took off his hat, it was an old lumpy one, and he puts it on his stock and gives it a spin and said, Hat, it's paid. Oh thank you, that's right, said the waiter. That's quite a hat, said the men, can you do it again. Sure, we can try, they went in to another place. Now I want to try said one of the men. Sure enough, it was right. The hat paid. Sure, said the second man, now you've tried it, now I want to try it too. To make a long story short, it went the same way the third place. When they came out, they said, Listen, Jens, you don't really need that hat, you don't get out like us and you don't make as many bargains, give it to us. Jens wouldn't hear tell of that. Finally, they convince him to sell the hat for 50 rixdollars, and even then Jens felt he'd given it to them. They thought so too. When Jens got the money, he headed quickly for home. They said, let's have a little more fun with this hat comedy. They go off and get another man to come with them and go to an inn and order a huge amount. When they're done, the first man takes the hat, gives it a good spin, Hat it is paid for. Wait a second, my good man, we don't accept hat tricks here. What, isn't it paid for. No. Out with your money, you have to pay. Then the other man says, it was the wrong side you spun it on, let me try. They go in to another inn. They got themselves a good beating there and then they could go home. They were quite disappointed and then the first man said, We can take the money back from him because the two of us can take him. About evening time the next day they cross over the heath to him. Jens is sitting in the window. Now the Hemstok men are coming and they don't have good ideas, but I'll try to see if I can't trick them again and then he told his mother a little bit about how she should act when they arrived. The men come in and greet them good evening. They invited them in and asked them to sit down. They had come to talk about the deal, they didn't think it had been so honest, but he said no, they had seen the goods, and he couldn't help it if they didn't have the right touch. As they're sitting there talking back and forth, the woman is sitting there spinning, and she's nodding off at the spinning wheel and finally she falls completely asleep. OK, says Jens, let me see if I can't put a little zeal into you. He grabs a big staff that was right near him and smacks her really hard on the back of her head, the poor old thing, and she falls off the chair and remains lying there. Wow, you're a dangerous guy, you killed your own mother. Oh, there's no danger of that, says Jens, and he shakes her a bit. She's beyond that. No, there's no danger of that and he reaches up to a shelf and takes a whistle that's lying there and bends down to the back of her head and begins blowing. And the old woman jumps right up, oh, I was having such a nice dream and she sits down to spin as if nothing had happened and spins so that the spinning wheel crackles. Well, the men look a little at this. You know what, Jens, if you'll give us that whistle, then we'll forget the whole hat comedy thing, because they could use that whistle, their women were so tired of them. Well, they got the whistle and they went home quite happy. Then the man in the western farm says, I want to try the whistle first, you tried the hat first and this time there's no cheating because that old woman, she was dead. And the next evening he's sitting inside with his women and eagerly waits for one of them to fall asleep, so that he could try this thing. Well, it was now this and that, because these were some darn secure women, so if they didn't have it pretty good, he risked hearing about it later. If you're going to hit, then you really need to hit, otherwise it won't work. Then after a while, the wife fell asleep and she slept soundly. Then he'd put a really thick cudgel in a corner to use for that purpose, he pulls it out and he smacks her one right in the face and she falls over as dead as a herring. What are you doing, did you kill your own wife, you're quite a daring person. Oh, there's no danger, I'll wake her up again, don't complain, and he takes the whistle and blows it in the back of her head, so water came out of both his eyes, but it didn't help. Then he says to the others: you better keep quiet about this, because the other one has to try this, I don't want to be the only one to be hurt like this, and to make a long story short, the same thing happened to the other one. Now they were busy for several days getting their wives buried and so Jens had peace for a while. In the meantime, some gypsies had wandered by and had gotten lodgings at Jens's and they had some foreign animals with them, and they'd left a wolf with Jens and he had no idea what he should do with it. Then a little later the men come down to him one day and begin to blame him for having them kill their wives and all that. Then he says, I'm not at fault, because you saw what I did, and you hit wrong. But I've gotten a ram here and I'll give it to you so we can stay friends. He looks like he's pulling a bit at the ropes, said the first man. Yes, he is, said Jens, but he's a foreign race and he is healthy and energetic and when he is put out in a flock of sheep, there'll be no illness among the sheep. In those days, they had a really hard time keeping their sheep alive, because they always got sick. And there's one more thing--he's really good at taking care of the lambs. The foxes won't get a single lamb. Then they thought: OK, let's have him, something is better than nothing and they got the ram and they led him home. They had their sheep down below the farms and it was covered with snow, so they drove all their sheep into a fold, since they always drove their animals together. Then they said to their people, don't check on them for a few days, he needs time to get to know them, otherwise he'll run away. Well, the end of the ballad was that the wolf bit a bunch of sheep to death and broke a hole in the roof and ran away and they didn't see the wolf again. Then a little time passed and the men went about wondering about the animal that had eaten their sheep and finally it occurred to them that he'd played a trick on them. But now the winter had gotten so harsh, there was nothing they could do to him. But Jens hadn't gotten lazy, he went down and bought himself an old nag, and he'd set it up there. Then toward spring time, they came down to him one day and they asked him, what kind of beast is that you've gotten yourself Jens. That's an animal that really helps out a lot, it doesn't look like much, but it's good anyway. He'd tied an upside down basket onto its ass. What's that supposed to mean, it hanging there like that. Oh, then I don't have to have the bother of picking up the money out of the shit. Well, then they wanted to go have a look, and there was a bunch of fertilizer, but also some copper coins. What, can that animal give money. Sure, you can see that yourself and at the same time he smacks the animal's ass and some more trickle out from its tail. Well, it sure looks that way, it would certainly be worth it having one like that. Yes, said Jens, it's a good investment, but not for me since I can't afford to give it good food. The better the food, the more money. Yes, the end of the ballad was that they got Jens to give them the animal and then they led it home. One of them got it first and he let it go about in one of his best rooms and he carried a bunch of oats in to it, and a bunch of bed clothes so that it would be comfortable, since he figured the better it lay the more money he'd get. But it turned out it ruined everything and no money. The other man got it to try too; it went the same way for him. Then they said to each other: Now we're going to destroy him, otherwise he'll destroy us and they went out there together and they put him in a sack they'd brought with them and it was a Sunday morning. Then they thought that they were so close to the church, they'd go in and listen to the sermon and so they left him lying quietly outside the church wall. Then he says, as he's lying there, no I don't ever want to go to heaven. An old man is walking by at that moment. I certainly do, said the man, if I could get there. You can get there easily, if you'll climb into this sack, said the boy. Well, then the two of us better switch. He opened up for the boy and climbs into the bag and the boy ties it up good and tight for him. When the men had listened to the end of the sermon, then they go out and pick up the bag again and then they head off. This old guy asked them, will we get there soon. Yes, it won't be long now, before you get there and he was happy with that. When they got down to Ravn lake, they threw him out there and then they went home. But along the way they meet Jens whose coming driving a big herd of cows, they were the men's own, they wandered about loose in the forest and he went there driving a herd of them. Hey, where did you find those cows. I found them at the bottom of the lake, there's a wonderful pasture, and there were so many cows grazing there. Oh really, they said, we'd better go down and get us a herd as well, when it's like that. But now we'll be careful and only one of us will go at a time, and when he gets down then he'll call up. That's what happened, and when the first one jumped out, it said Plom and he thought he said, Come, and then he jumped in after him and then they both drowned because of their greed. Since then, Jens and his mother lived peacefully and they acted like people did back then. One more thing. Gets hold of a fox and convinces them that it's a gander and they lead it up to their goose pen and it killed all the geese and then it broke a hole in the wall and ran off, and they never saw it again.", "danish_publication": "Der ude paa Dover Hede laa et lille Hus, og i det boede ikke andre end en gammel Kone og hendes S\u00f8n. En Dag, som Konen var ved at v\u00e6ve, blev hun lige f\u00e6rdig med et kj\u00f8nt Stykke Vadmel, og saa siger hun til Kn\u00e6gten: \"H\u00f8r, Jens, nu kan du tage det Stykke Vadmel og gaa til Aarhus med og s\u00e6lge for mig. Det kan ikke hj\u00e6lpe, du gaar til Skanderborg, for der kan du ikke blive af med det, og du skal have en Mark for Alen. Men lad mig nu se, du b\u00e6rer dig lidt ordentlig ad.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det skal a nok,\" siger han, og han tager T\u00f8jet og gaar med. Saa gaar han nu om ad Hemstok. Der staar de Hemstok M\u00e6nd uden for og Snakker. \"Hvor skal du hen med det T\u00f8j?\" siger de, \"du farer saa st\u00e6rkt.\" \u2014 \"Ja, a skal til Aarhus med det for min Moder.\" \u2014 \"Naa, det skal du, hvad skal det da koste?\" \u2014 \"Det skal koste en Mark.\" \u2014 \"Ja, saa er det da ikke v\u00e6rd, du gaar l\u00e6ngere for den Sags Skyld, saa vil vi tage det.\" Det var Kn\u00e6gten saa meget glad til, og han faar hans Mark, og de faar Vadmelet. Saa gik han hjem til hans Moder med det. Da hun fik at h\u00f8re, hvordan han havde baaret sig ad, siger hun: \"Ja, a tvivlte nok paa, det vilde gaa dig galt, bitte Jens. Der er ikke mere ved det at gj\u00f8re, for kjender a de Hemstok M\u00e6nd rigtig, saa holder de nok ved det, de faar fat i.\" Det sagde Jens ikke noget til.\nEn Dags Tid efter var hun ved at kj\u00e6rne, og da hun havde faaet Sm\u00f8r, siger hun til Drengen: \"Her har du nu dether Sm\u00f8r og dether Kj\u00e6rnem\u00e6lk, det maa helst blive sammen i Kj\u00e6rnen med hinandt, og saa skal du tage det paa din Ryg og gaa over til Polakkerne med det.\" Det var i den Tid, de huserede her i Jylland, og de havde deres Baase i den By, der hedder Boes, deraf fik den sit Navn. Derfra kunde de overse hele Landet, for det ligger saa h\u00f8jt, og tilligemed kunde ingen komme til dem uden fra \u00e9n Side, alle de andre var omfl\u00f8dt med Vand. Nu gjorde Konen jo Regning paa at kunne afs\u00e6tte nogle F\u00f8devarer til dem, for noget skulde de jo altid have at leve af. \"Lad mig nu endelig se, bitte Jens, te de narrer dig ikke.\" \u2014 \"Nej,\" siger han, \"den Gang skal de mins\u00e6l ikke komme til at narre mig mere end dether Halmstraa,\" siger han Kn\u00e6gten, og saa bukker han sig ned og vil tage ved Halmstraaet, men tager sig ikke i Vare for, at Kj\u00e6rnem\u00e6lken og Sm\u00f8rret gik ud over Hovedet paa ham. \"Nej, det er dog bedr\u00f8veligt med saadan et Knudhoved,\" siger Moderen. \"Jaja, I er ogsaa saa hiddsig,\" siger han Kn\u00e6gten, \"men lad mig nu faa Tid til at bet\u00e6nke mig, saa skal a missel nok faa dem pudset der oppe.\"\n     Dermed gik Jens, og saa spekulerede han paa det i nogle Dage. Han s\u00f8rgede jo for at faa et Stykke L\u00e6rred af hans Moder, for der skulde v\u00e6re Marked i Skanderborg, og saa foregav han jo, at han vilde derned og s\u00e6lge det. Han rejser ogsaa af og faar hans L\u00e6rred solgt, saa han faar lidt M\u00f8nt paa Lommen. I det samme faar han at se, at de Hemstok M\u00e6nd var ogsaa der nede. Saa gaar han ind til tre V\u00e6rter og S\u00e6tter dem til Hobe lidt ind i Sagerne, angaaende hvordan han vilde betale de M\u00e6nd for deres Snyderi imod ham, og saa giver han hver af dem saa mange Skillinger, som en Omgang kunde koste. Naa, saa gaar han ud igjen og leder de to M\u00e6nd op. Han byder dem altsaa ind paa en Gjenstand. \"Aa,\" siger de, \"vi tykkes ikke, det er v\u00e6rd, du spenderer noget paa os, Jens.\" Ja\u2014a, han brystede sig jo noget, \"a kan vel komme til at handle med jer en anden Gang.\" \u2014 \"Jaja,\" siger saa den ene Mand, \"lad os saa gaa ind med dig.\" \u2014 \"Hej, V\u00e6rt, lad os faa et Krus Polak!\" \u2014 det var en Drik, der var meget almindelig den Gang og bestod halvt af Br\u00e6ndevin og halvt af Mj\u00f8d. V\u00e6rten kom strags springende med det, og den Gang de var f\u00e6rdige, tog Jens hans Hat af, det var saadan en gammel buleret \u00e9n, og s\u00e6tter paa hans Kj\u00e6p og giver den et Snur og Siger: \"Hat, det er jo betalt.\" \u2014 \"A takker,\" siger V\u00e6rten, \"det passer.\" \u2014 \"Det var en grumme Hat,\" siger de Hemstok M\u00e6nd, \"kan den gj\u00f8re det \u00e9n Gang til?\" \u2014 \"Ja, vi kan jo pr\u00f8ve ad.\" De gik saa ind et andet Sted. \"Ja, nu vil a missel pr\u00f8ve den,\" siger den ene af M\u00e6ndene, og Jens kr\u00e6ver ind, og Manden snurrede med den. Jo, det paste godt nok. Hatten den betalte. \"Ja,\" siger den anden Mand, \"nu har du pr\u00f8vet den, da vil a ogsaa se at give den et Snur.\" Det gik kort at fort\u00e6lle lige saadan det tredje Sted. Jens sagde: \"Hat, du har jo betalt\", og V\u00e6rten kom Springende og sagde: \"A takker, det passer.\" Da de kom ud, sagde M\u00e6ndene: \"H\u00f8r, Jens, den Hat kan du overlade os, den har du egentlig ingen Brug for, da du ikke kommer videre ud, saadan som os, og giver ikke mange Lidkj\u00f8b.\" Men det vilde Jens ikke h\u00f8re om. Endelig faar de ham overtalt til at s\u00e6lge Hatten for en 50 Rigsdaler, og saa mente Jens endda, han havde givet dem den. Det tykte de da endelig ogsaa selv. Da Jens fik Pengene, str\u00f8g han af hjem.\n     Saa sagde M\u00e6ndene: \"Vi vil have lidt mere Forn\u00f8jelse af den Hattekomedie.\" De gaar hen og faar en Tredjemand med, og saa triner de ind til en V\u00e6rt og kr\u00e6ver dygtig ind. Da de er f\u00e6rdige, tager den ene Mand Hatten og giver den et Sno, rette den spillede paa Kj\u00e6ppen. \"Hat, det er jo betalt,\" siger han, men V\u00e6rten sagde noget andet. \"Nej, holdt, god Karl, her gaar det ikke til med Hunderkunster.\" \u2014 \"Hvad, er det ikke betalt?\" siger de. \"Nej, I maa op med Pengene, hvem skulde have betalt for jer?\" og de maatte altsaa punge ud. Saa siger den anden Mand, da de var kommen uden for: \"Jamen det var ogsaa den fejle Side, du snoede til, lad mig nu pr\u00f8ve den.\" Saa gaar de ind paa et andet V\u00e6rtshus og spiser og drikker, og der reddede de dem en god Tragt Kl\u00f8, saa kunde de gaa hjem med det. \u00c6rgerlige var de, og det til Gavns.\n     \"Vi skal lige godt have ham af med de Penge igjen,\" siger den ene Mand, \"for han har jo snydt os vel grovt, og vi kan nok magte ham begge to.\" Hen paa anden Dags Aften tridser de ud i Heden til ham. Jens kikker ud paa Vinderet og siger: \"Nu kommer de Hemstok M\u00e6nd, og de har ikke godt i Sinde, men a vil lige godt pr\u00f8ve, om a kan ikke narre dem nok en Gang.\" Saa gav han Moderen lidt Underretning om, hvordan hun skulde forholde sig, naar de kom. M\u00e6ndene de kommer ind og hilser Godaften. Folkene b\u00f8d dem jo fra D\u00f8ren at sidde ned, og de kommer saa til at snakke med ham om den Handel. De mente jo, den var ikke saa rele, som den kunde v\u00e6re. Men Jens paastod, at de havde jo set paa Varerne, og han kunde ikke gj\u00f8re for, te de havde ikke det riglige haandelag. Som de nu sidder og snakker frem og tilbage, da sidder Konen ved Rokken og spinder, og hun nikker lidt, og til sidst falder hun helt i S\u00f8vn. \"Naa, du har det saadan,\" siger Jens, \"da skal a lige godt se, om a kan ikke faa lidt Arbejdslyst i dig,\" og dermed tog han en stor Kj\u00e6p, der stod i Nabolaget ved ham, og tr\u00e6kker hende jo en alvorlig \u00e9n over Nakken, det gamle Skind, saa hun v\u00e6lter ned af Stolen og bliver liggende. \"Ja, da er du og en farlig Kn\u00e6gt,\" siger M\u00e6ndene, \"slaar du din egen Moder ihjel.\" \u2014 \"Aa, det har nok ingen Fare,\" siger Jens og rundsler lidt ved hende. \"Ja, hun er missel vist ovre det,\" siger de. \"Nej, det er der ingen Fare for\", og han r\u00e6kker op paa en Hylde og tager en fl\u00f8jte, der laa, og den s\u00e6tter han om i hendes Nakke og giver sig til at bl\u00e6se. Op springer hun Kj\u00e6llingen lige paa en Studs og siger: \"Aa, da dr\u00f8mte a endda godt.\" Hun s\u00e6tter sig da til at spinde, som om ingen Ting var forefaldt, og det, lige til det knasede i Rokkev\u00e6rket. Ja, M\u00e6ndene de keg jo lidt paa dether. \"Ja, ved du hvad, Jens,\" siger de, \"naar du vil give os den Fl\u00f8jte, saa skal det hele v\u00e6re glemt med den Hattekommers,\" for den Fl\u00f8jte kunde de bruge, deres Kvindfolk var nemlig slemt s\u00f8vnige af sig. Naa, de fik Fl\u00f8jten, og de gik nok saa glade og vel forn\u00f8jede hjem. Saa siger Manden i den vestre Gaard: \"Ja, nu vil a missel pr\u00f8ve Flojten f\u00f8rst, du pr\u00f8vede Hatten f\u00f8rst. Denher Gang er det da intet Snyderi, for vi saa jo, Kj\u00e6llingen hun var d\u00f8d og blev levende igjen.\"\n     Anden Dags Aften sidder han inde i Stuen ved hans kvindfolk og venter jo saa haardt paa, te den ene af dem skulde falde i S\u00f8vn, for at han kunde komme til at pr\u00f8ve denher Indretning. Nu var det jo baade saa og da, for det var nogle Fandens sikre Kvindfolk, han havde, og hvis de ikke fik et rigtig godt Tr\u00e6k, saa kunde han risikere at faa det gjengj\u00e6ldt bag efter. Det sad han nu og t\u00e6nkte paa. \"Skal der slaaes til, saa skal der slaaes til, for ellers gaar det ikke,\" t\u00e6nkte han ved sig selv. Omsider falder da Konen i S\u00f8vn f\u00f8rst og sov baade trygt og fast. Nu havde han sat en tyk Kj\u00e6p i en Krog til det samme Brug, og saa tr\u00e6kker han den frem og giver hende \u00e9n ind lige i Planeten, og hun v\u00e6lter jo om saa d\u00f8d som en Sild. \"Men hvad gj\u00f8r du nu!\" siger de andre, og Springer op og hujer og skriger, \"slaar du nu din egen Kone ihjel, da er du og et forvovent Menneske.\" \u2014 \"Aa, det har ingen Fare,\" siger han, \"a skal nok faa hende vaagen, I skal ikke klage jer.\" Han tager i Fl\u00f8jten og piber i Nakken paa hende, saa Vandet kom ud af begge hans \u00d8jne, men lige meget hjalp det. Saa siger han til hans Folk: \"Nu maa I endelig tie stille med det, for min Nabomand skal missel pr\u00f8ve det ogsaa, a vil ikke v\u00e6re ene om Skaden.\" Og kort at fort\u00e6lle, det gik den anden akkurat lige saadan.\n     Nu fik de jo travlt i nogle Dage med at faa deres Koner begravet, og saa havde Jens da Fred i den Tid. Imelder godlag var nogle Tattere dreven omkring og havde haft Logi ved Jens, og de havde et udenlands Tyr med dem, som de kaldte en Ulv. Saa havde de ladt den blive ved ham, og han vidste aldrig, hvad han skulde gj\u00f8re ved det Kreatur. Omsider kommer M\u00e6ndene ned til ham en Dag og begynder at Skylde ham for, at han havde slaaet deres Koner ihjel og alt dether. Dertil svarer han: \"Ja, a har jo ingen Skyld i det, for I saa jo, hvordan a bar mig ad, og I maa jo have slaaet fejl. Men a har faaet en V\u00e6dder her, den vil a give jer, for at vi kan blive ved at holde Venskab.\" \u2014 \"A tykkes, han ser mig saa strag ud i Tovet,\" siger den anden Mand. \"Ja, det er han ogsaa,\" mente Jens, \"men det er af en udenlandsk Race, og han er frisk og sund, og der er den store Fordel ved at have ham, te hvor han kommer i en Flok Faar, der kommer ingen Sygen imeld dem.\" I de Tider havde de nemlig saa ondt ved at holde Liv i deres Faar, for der var tit Sygen imeld dem, og mange d\u00f8de hver Vinter. \"Og saa er der endelig \u00e9n Ting til\", siger Jens, \"og det er, at han er saa god til at passe paa Lammene, og naar I har ham, saa kan R\u00e6ven ingen Lam tage.\" De tykte endelig ogsaa, at den var v\u00e6rd at have. \"Lad os tage ham, noget er bedre end intet,\" sagde de, og saa fik de denher V\u00e6dder og tr\u00e6kkede af hjem med ham.\n     De havde deres Faarefold neden for Gaardene, og lige i Tiden var Markerne lagt til med Sne, saa de havde drevet alle deres Faar ind i en Fold, og begge M\u00e6ndene drev altid sammen med deres Faar. Da de nu lader Ulven komme ind til dem, sagde de til deres Folk: \"Nu skal I ikke se til dem den f\u00f8rste Dags Tid, han skal have Tid til at blive kjendt med dem, ellers vil han vel rende hen, naar Faarene kommer ud igjen.\" Naa, Enden af Visen blev, at Ulven bed en Del af faarene ihjel og br\u00e6kkede saa Hul paa Taget og rendte sin Vej, og de saa ingen V\u00e6dder siden. Da Folkene kommer hen og skal have set til deres Faar, saa laa de der i en bedr\u00f8velig Forfatning.\n     Nu gik der en lille Tid, og M\u00e6ndene gik og grubliserede over, hvad det var for et Dyr, der saadan havde \u00f8dt dem deres Faar. Omsider kom de i Tanker om, at det var ogsaa en Kj\u00e6ltringstreg, Jens havde spillet dem. Men nu var det blevet saa str\u00e6ng en Vinter, te nu var der ikke noget at spekulere paa med ham for det f\u00f8rste.\n     Men Jens havde ikke ligget paa den dovne Side i det Lag. Han havde gaaet ned og kj\u00f8bt sig et Udgangs\u00f8g, og det havde han faaet indkvarteret hjemme i Huset. Saa hen i Foraarstiden kom M\u00e6ndene ud til ham en Dag, og de faar strags dether \u00d8g at se. \"Hvad er det for et B\u00e6st, du har der lagt dig til, Jens?\" \u2014 \"Det B\u00e6st er der stor Fortjeneste ved,\" siger han, \"det ser ikke ud til ret meget, men det er godt alligevel.\" Nu havde han jo set, M\u00e6ndene de kom, og saa havde han bundet en vendret Kurv for R\u00f8ven af det. \"Hvad skal det betyde, den Kurv h\u00e6nger der?\" siger de. \"Aa,\" siger han, \"det er for ikke at have for megen Ulejlighed med at samle pengene op i Skidtet.\" Ja, saa Skulde de jo hen at se i Kurven, og der var en Hoben Gj\u00f8dning, men ogsaa nogle Kobberskillinger. \"Hvad! kan det B\u00e6st gj\u00f8re Penge?\" siger de. \"Ja, det kan I da vel se,\" og saa med det samme skaar han et godt Slag over R\u00f8ven af det. Da trimler der nogle Skillinger ud fra Halen. \"Ja, det ser ud til det,\" siger de, \"saadan et Dyr kunde det nok v\u00e6re v\u00e6rd at have.\" \u2014 \"Ja,\" siger Jens, \"der er god Fortjeneste ved det Dyr, men ikke saa meget for mig, for a har jo ikke Raad til at give B\u00e6stet saa god en F\u00f8de, som det skulde have. Jo flere penge, jo bedre F\u00f8de det faar.\" Ja, Enden paa Visen blev da, at de fik Jens til at overlade dem \u00d8get, og saa tr\u00e6kker de jo hjem med det. Manden i den vestre Gaard fik det f\u00f8rst, og han lod det gaa ind i en af hans bedste Stuer, og han bar en hel Del Havre ind til det og en hel Del Sengkl\u00e6der, at det Skulde ligge godt, for han mente jo, at jo bedre det laa, jo flere Penge det fik. Men det viste sig snart, at \u00d8get spolerede dem alting og alligevel ingen penge gjorde. Den anden Mand fik det at pr\u00f8ve ogsaa, og ham gik det lige saadan.\n     Nu kan det nok v\u00e6re, de var blevne vrede paa Jens, og de l\u00e6gger over med hinanden: \"Nu skal han l\u00e6gges \u00f8de, for ellers l\u00e6gger han os \u00f8de.\" Saa fulgtes de ad derned igjen, og de fik fat i ham og put ham i en S\u00e6k, de havde med dem. Det var en S\u00f8ndag Morgen, dether gik for sig. De rejser saa af med ham i S\u00e6kken, og da deres Vej faldt lige forbi Kirken, saa vilde de da ind og h\u00f8re Pr\u00e6kenen. Saa kunde de lade ham ligge uden for Kirkegaardsmuren i god Rolighed ilav, og de smider S\u00e6kken og gaar ind. Allerbedst som han nu ligger der, siger han saadan temmelig h\u00f8jt: \"Nej, a vil ikke til Himmels for aldrig det.\" Saa kommer der en gammel Mand forbi i det samme, og han h\u00f8rer det. \"Da vilde a saam\u00e6nd gj\u00e6rne til Himmerig, dersom a kunde komme der.\" \u2014 \"Ja, da kan du nemt komme der,\" siger Jens i S\u00e6kken, \"dersom du vil krybe ind i denher S\u00e6k, saa maa vi to hellere komme til at bytte, for a skal netop til Himmerig.\" Han l\u00f8ser for Kn\u00e6gten, og Jens kryber ud, men den gamle Mand kravlede i den, og Kn\u00e6gten binder rigtig godt for ham.\n     Da M\u00e6ndene de havde h\u00f8rt Tjenesten til Ende, saa kommer de jo ud og tager Posen igjen, og saa drager de af Sted med den. Denher gamle Gut han spurgte dem ivessomda: \"Er vi der snart?\" \u2014 \"Ja, nu skal det ikke vare l\u00e6nge, inden du kommer der,\" siger de, og saa gav han sig tilfreds. Da de kom ned til Ravn S\u00f8, saa smed de ham ud, og saa gik de hjem. Men undervejs mellem S\u00f8en og Boes kommer de forbi Jens, han kom drivende med et pr\u00e6gtigt Kobbel H\u00f8veder, det var nogle af M\u00e6ndenes egne, der gik l\u00f8se nede i Skoven, og der havde han givet sig til at gaa og drive med en hj\u00e6r af dem. \"Hvad, er du her? hvor er du kommen ved de H\u00f8veder?\" \u2014 \"Ja, dem har a faaet paa Bunden af S\u00f8en. Der er jo en dejlige Eng, og der gik saa mange Havk\u00f8er og gik og gr\u00e6ssede.\" \u2014 \"Naa, det gjorde der,\" sagde de, \"saa maa vi hellere gaa ned og faa os en Hj\u00e6r ogsaa, naar det gaar saadan til at faa dem. Men nu vil vi v\u00e6re saa forsigtige, at kun \u00e9n af os gaar ad Gangen, og naar den saa kommer derned, og det forholder sig rigtigt, hvad Kn\u00e6gten har opgivet, saa skal den kalde.\" Det skete nu ogsaa. Idet den f\u00f8rste Sprang ud, saa sagde det: \"Plom!\" og den anden han vidste ikke andet, end han sagde: \"Kom!\" Saa sprang han bag efter. De druknede altsaa begge to formedelst deres Gjerrighed. Siden den Tid levede Jens og hans Moder i Rolighed, og de begik dem som Folk i deres Stilling nu om Stunder.\n\nFort\u00e6lleren har ogsaa h\u00f8rt historien fort\u00e6lle med endnu et Tr\u00e6k. Jens havde faaet fat i en R\u00e6v og bilder dem saa ind, at det er en Gasse. Den tr\u00e6kker de op i deres Gaasesti og lader den v\u00e6re ved Gj\u00e6ssene om Natten. Den spolerede dem allesammen, og siden br\u00e6kkede den hul paa Muren og l\u00f8b, saa de fik ikke mere ud af det.\n", "english_publication": "Out there on Dover heath lay a tiny little house, and no one lived there but an old woman and her son. One day as the woman was weaving, she finished up a very nice piece of homespun and so she says to the boy: \u201cListen Jens, now you can take this piece of homespun and go to \u00c5rhus with it and sell it for me. It won\u2019t help going to Skanderborg, because you won\u2019t be able to get rid of it there, and you\u2019re to get one mark for each two foot length. But please show me that you can do this properly.\u201d\u2014\u201cI certainly will,\u201d he says, and he takes the cloth and goes off. Now he goes past Hemstok. The Hemstok men are standing outside there talking. \u201cWhere are you going with that cloth?\u201d they say, \u201cyou\u2019re going so fast.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, I\u2019m bringing it to \u00c5rhus for my mother.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, are you now? How much does it cost?\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt costs one mark.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, then it\u2019s not worth your trouble going any farther for that, we\u2019ll take it.\u201d The boy was quite happy about that and he gets his mark and they get the homespun. Then he went home to his mother with the money. When she heard how he\u2019d handled himself, she said, \u201cWell, I certainly had my doubts that things would go well for you little Jens. There\u2019s nothing else to do, since if I know those Hemstok men, they\u2019ll hold on to what they\u2019ve got.\u201d Jens didn\u2019t say anything in reply.\nOne day later, she was out churning and when she had gotten butter, she says to the boy: \u201cListen, here you\u2019ve got this butter and this buttermilk, it\u2019s best if they are in the churn together; put it on your back and go over to the Poles with it.\u201d It was in the days when the Poles were quartered here in Jutland and they had their stalls [b\u00e5se] in a town named Boes, and that\u2019s how it got its name. They could watch over the entire area from there, because it sits fairly high, and by the same token nobody could come at them from one side, and all the other sides were flooded with water. Now the woman counted on being able to sell them some foodstuffs, because they would always need something to live off. \u201cLet me see that they don\u2019t trick you, little Jens.\u201d\u2014\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cthis time they sure as heck won\u2019t trick me any more than this here piece of straw,\u201d says the boy and then he bends over to pick up the piece of straw, but isn\u2019t careful and the butter and milk spill over his head. \u201cOh, it\u2019s a real shame with such a churl,\u201d says the mother. \u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re also so hot-headed,\u201d says the boy, \u201cbut give me a moment to think, I\u2019ll certainly trick those guys up there in Hemstok.\u201d\n     Then Jens went and thought about it for several days. He made sure to get a piece of canvas from his mother, because there was going to be a market in Skanderborg, and he told her that he wanted to go down there and sell it. He goes off and sells his canvas and gets a few coins in his pocket. At that moment, he sees that the Hemstock men are down there too. So he goes to three innkeepers and tells them a bit about how things stand, and how he wants to pay the two men back for their trickery and then he gives each of them enough shillings to pay for a round of drinks. Well, then he goes out again and finds these two men. He invites them in for a drink. \u201cWell,\u201d they say, \u201cwe don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it spending your money on us Jens.\u201d \u201cWell--,\u201d Jens puffed himself up a bit, \u201cI could certainly wind up making a deal with you another time.\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, sure,\u201d says one of the men, \u201clet\u2019s go in with you.\u201d\u2014\u201cHey, innkeeper, give us a pitcher of Polak!\u201d-- that was a common drink in those days, it was half beer and half mead. The innkeeper brings it over immediately and when they were done, Jens took off his hat, it was an old lumpy one, and he puts it on his staff and gives it a whirl and says, \u201cHat, it\u2019s paid.\u201d \u2013 \u201cI thank you,\u201d says the innkeeper, \u201cthat\u2019s quite right.\u201d \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s quite a hat,\u201d the Hemstok men say, \u201ccan you do it again?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, we can try.\u201d So they went to another place. \u201cNow I sure as heck want to try,\u201d says one of the men, and Jens orders, and the man spun it. Sure enough, it was right. The hat paid. \u201cWell,\u201d says the other man, \u201cnow that you\u2019ve tried it, I want to try it too.\u201d To make a long story short, it went the same way at the third place. Jens said, \u201cHat, you\u2019ve paid,\u201d and the innkeeper came running and said, \u201cI thank you, that\u2019s right.\u201d When they came out, the men said, \u201cListen, Jens, you can give us that hat, you don\u2019t really need it, you don\u2019t get out like us and make as many deals.\u201d But Jens wouldn\u2019t hear talk of that. Finally, they convince him to sell them the hat for fifty rixdollars, and even then Jens felt he\u2019d given it to them. They thought so too, actually. When Jens got the money, he headed quickly for home. \n     Then the men said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a little more fun with this hat comedy.\u201d They go off and get another man to come with them and go to an inn and order a huge amount. When they\u2019re done, the first man takes the hat, gives it a good spin, so that it almost fell off the staff. \u201cHat, it is paid for,\u201d he says, but the innkeeper said something else. \u201cWait a second, my good man, we don\u2019t accept monkey tricks here.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWhat, isn\u2019t it paid for?\u201d they say. \u201cNo, you better come with your money, who was supposed to have paid for you?\u201d and they had to pay. Then the other man says, when they\u2019d gotten outside, \u201cIt was the wrong side you spun it on, let me try.\u201d They go in to another inn and they eat and drink, and they got themselves a good beating there and then they could go home. They were quite disappointed.\n     \u201cWe can take the money back from him,\u201d says the first man, \u201cbecause he has tricked us quite badly, and the two of us can take him.\u201d About evening time the next day they cross over the heath to him. Jens looks out the window and says, \u201cNow the Hemstok men are coming and they don\u2019t have good thoughts, but I\u2019ll try to see if I can\u2019t trick them again.\u201d Then he told his mother a little bit about how she should act when they arrived. The men come in and wish them a good evening. They invited them in and asked them to sit down and they had come to talk with him about the deal. They didn\u2019t think it had been as honest as it could have been. But Jens claimed that they had seen the goods, and he couldn\u2019t help it if they didn\u2019t have the right touch. As they\u2019re sitting there talking back and forth, his mother is sitting there spinning at the spinning wheel, and she\u2019s nodding off and finally she falls asleep. \u201cOh, you\u2019re like that,\u201d says Jens, \u201clet me see if I can\u2019t put a little zeal back into you,\u201d and with that he grabs a big staff that was right near him and smacks her really hard on the back of her head, the poor old thing, and she falls off the chair and remains lying there. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a dangerous guy,\u201d says the man, \u201cyou just killed your own mother.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh, there\u2019s no danger of that,\u201d says Jens, and he shakes her a bit. \u201cYes, she\u2019s probably beyond that,\u201d they say. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no danger of that,\u201d and he reaches up to a shelf and takes a whistle that\u2019s lying there and bends down to the back of her head and begins blowing. And the hag jumps right up, \u201cOh, I was having such a nice dream.\u201d She sits down to spin as if nothing had happened and spins so that the spinning wheel crackles. Well, the men look a little at this. \u201cYou know what, Jens,\u201d they say, \u201cif you\u2019ll give us that whistle, then we\u2019ll forget the whole hat comedy thing,\u201d because they could use that whistle, their women were so tired of them. Well, they got the whistle and they went home quite happy. Then the man in the western farm says, \u201cI sure as heck want to try the whistle first, you tried the hat first. This time there\u2019s no cheating because was saw that the old woman was dead and came back to life.\u201d\n     The next evening he\u2019s sitting inside in the living room with his women and is eagerly waiting for one of them to fall asleep so that he could try this thing. Well, it was now this and now that, because these were some darn strong women, so if they didn\u2019t hit them pretty hard, he risked getting it right back. He sat there and thought about that. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to hit, then you really need to hit hard, otherwise it won\u2019t work,\u201d he thought to himself. Then after a while, the wife fell asleep and she slept soundly. Now he\u2019d put a really thick cudgel in a corner to use for that purpose, he pulls it out and he smacks her one right in the face and she falls over as dead as a herring. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the others say, and they jump up shouting and yelling, \u201cDid you kill your own wife? You\u2019re quite a daring person!\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh, there\u2019s no danger,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll wake her up again, don\u2019t complain.\u201d He takes the whistle and blows it in the back of her head, so water came out of both his eyes, but it didn\u2019t help. Then he says to the others: \u201cNow you\u2019d better keep quiet about this, because my neighbor sure as heck has to try this, I don\u2019t want to be the only one to be hurt like this.\u201d To make a long story short, exactly the same thing happened to the other one. \n     Now they were busy for several days getting their wives buried and so Jens had peace for a while. In the meantime, some gypsies had wandered by and had gotten lodgings at Jens\u2019s and they had a foreign animal with them they called a wolf. They had left it with him and he had no idea what he should do with that animal. Then a little later the men come down to him one day and begin to blame him, saying he had killed their wives and all that. To that he answers, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not at fault there, because you saw what I did, and you must have hit wrong. But I\u2019ve gotten a ram here and I\u2019ll give it to you so we can stay friends.\u201d\u2014\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s pulling a bit at the ropes,\u201d says the other man. \u201cYes, he is,\u201d said Jens, \u201cbut it\u2019s a foreign race and he is healthy and energetic, and the real advantage with him is that when he is put out in a flock of sheep, there\u2019ll be no illness among them.\u201d In those days, they had a really hard time keeping their sheep alive, because they always got sick. \u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing\u2014he\u2019s really good at taking care of the lambs, and when you have him, the foxes won\u2019t get a single lamb.\u201d They finally thought that it was worth having. \u201cLet\u2019s have him, something is better than nothing,\u201d they said, and they got this ram and led him home. \n     They had their sheepfold down below the farms and just at that time the fields were covered with snow, so they had driven all their sheep into a single fold, because the two men always drove their sheep together. When they released the wolf into the sheep, they said to their people: \u201cNow you\u2019re not to check on them for a few days, he needs to time to get to know them, otherwise he\u2019ll run away when the sheep are let out again.\u201d Well, the end of the ballad was that the wolf bit a bunch of sheep to death and broke a hole in the roof and ran away and they didn\u2019t see the ram again. When the people came to see to their sheep, they lay there in terrible shape.\n     Now a little time passed and the men went about wondering about what kind of animal it was that had eaten their sheep. Finally it occurred to them that Jens had played a trick on them. But now the winter had gotten so harsh, there was nothing they could do to him. \n     But Jens hadn\u2019t gotten lazy during that time. He had gone down and bought himself an old nag, and he\u2019d housed it there in his house. Then toward spring time, the men came down to him one day and they immediately see this nag. \u201cWhat kind of a beast is that you\u2019ve gotten yourself Jens?\u201d\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to earn with that beast,\u201d he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like much, but it\u2019s good anyway.\u201d Now he had seen the men coming, and he\u2019d tied a basket onto its ass. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, that basket hanging there like that?\u201d they say. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cthat way I don\u2019t have to bother picking the money out of the shit.\u201d Well, then they wanted to go have a look in the basket, and there was a bunch of dung but also some copper coins. \u201cWhat, can that animal give money?\u201d they say. \u201cSure, you can see that yourself,\u201d and at the same time he smacks the animal\u2019s ass. Then some shillings trickle out from its tail. \u201cWell, it sure looks that way,\u201d they say, \u201cit would certainly be worth it, having an animal like that.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says Jens, \u201cit\u2019s a good investment this animal, but not for me since I can\u2019t afford to give it as good food as it needs. The better food it gets, the more money it gives.\u201d Well, the end of the ballad was that they got Jens to give them the animal and then they led it home. The man in the west farm got it first and he let it go about in one of his best rooms and he carried a bunch of oats in to it, and a bunch of bed clothes so that it would be comfortable, since he figured the better it lay the more money he\u2019d get. But it soon turned out that the nag ruined everything and still did not make any money. The other man got to try it too and it went the same way for him. \n     Now it could well be that they had gotten mad at Jens and they agree with each other: \u201cNow we\u2019re going to destroy him, otherwise he\u2019ll destroy us.\u201d So they went down there again and they catch him and put him in a sack they\u2019d brought with them. They now set off with him in the sack and since their path went right past the church, they decided they would go in and listen to the minister. They could leave him lying quietly outside the church wall, and so they toss the sack down and go in. As he\u2019s lying there, he says quite loudly, \u201cNo I don\u2019t ever want to go to heaven.\u201d An old man is walking by at that moment and he hears that. \u201cI certainly want to go to heaven if I can.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, you can get there easily,\u201d says Jens in the sack, \u201cif you\u2019ll climb into this sack, we\u2019d better switch places, because I\u2019m going to heaven right now.\u201d The old man opened up the sack for Jens and he climbs out, and the old man climbed into the bag and Jens ties it up good and tight for him. \n     When the Hemstok men had listened to the end of the sermon, they go out and pick up the bag again and then they head off with it. This old guy asked them, \u201cWill we get there soon?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, it won\u2019t be long now, before you get there,\u201d they say and he was happy with that. When they got down to Ravn lake, they threw him out there and then they went home. But along the way between the lake and Boes, they pass Jens, he was driving a big herd of cows, they were some of the men\u2019s own cows that wandered about loose in the forest and he had gone there and now was driving a herd of them. \u201cWhat, are you here? Where did you find those cows?\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, I found them at the bottom of the lake. There\u2019s a wonderful pasture, and there were so many cows grazing there.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh really,\u201d they said, \u201cwe\u2019d better go down and get us a herd as well, when it\u2019s like that. But now we\u2019ll be careful and only one of us will go at a time, and when he gets down there and it turns out to be true, what the boy has told us, then he\u2019ll call up.\u201d That\u2019s what happened. When the first one jumped out, it said \u201cPlom!\u201d and the other one thought he said, \u201cCome!\u201d and so he jumped in after him. Then they both drowned because of their greed. Since then, Jens and his mother lived peacefully and they acted like people did back then.\n\nThe teller has also heard the story told with one more event. Jens had gotten hold of a fox and then convinces them that it\u2019s a gander. They lead it up to their goose pen and let it stay with the geese.

The night raven is closely related to haunts (DS  II C 104 and II C 112), and in particular, the haunts of suicides (DS II C 106). In Peder's story, there is no indication that the raven had at one point been a human. In Danske sagn, the story is situated somewhat unusually in a section with stories about a giant bird that kills a bull, a story best known from the collections of Ole Worm (DS II C 118).\n\n    The motif of ravens participating in battle might be linked to Nordic mythology (Sk\u00e1ldskapam\u00e1l 60), which had been made broadly available to the Danish rural populace in large part through the efforts of NFS Grundtvig, and the h\u00f8jskole movement. \n\n     Svend Grundtvig proposes that the word valravn is related to the word varulv or werewolf, since in his interpretation, the valravn is a person who assumes the shape of a raven (DgF II, 480). This interpretation of the valravn derives from the ballad tradition, but does not align with Peder's description here. Rather, Peder's description aligns better with one of the etymologies that Grundtvig discards, namely the Old Icelandic word valr, which means \"the slain in battle\" (the name of Odin's hall, Valh\u00f6ll, hall of the battle slain, derives from valr, and offers an analogous example of compound formation with the stem val-).\n\n     The valravn appears in Danish ballad tradition (see in particular DgF 60; also DgF 61 and 62). The ballad was included in Vedel's collection and was also popular as a broadsheet (DgF II, 479). Oehlenschl\u00e4ger also wrote a poem, Valravnen (1803), that was based on the ballad German Gladesvend (DgF 33). Given Peder's description of the creature, it is unlikely that he was aware of the ballad or Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's poem.", "danish_manuscript": "Wolravne de blev af, naar de i Slaget ikke\nfik Kongen eller H\u00f8vdingen funden og begravet\nog der saa kom Ravne og aad af ham, de blev \ntil V. og den der aad hans Hj\u00e6rte den fik\nMskeforstand og kunde gj\u00f8re ondt og forvende\nMsker og var nogle skr\u00e6kk.

Changelings were generally identified by unusually slow (or fast) development, and unusual physical features. Many of these physical and behavioral characteristics of the \"changeling\" may have had factual counterparts attributable to birth defects, genetic disorders, or other early childhood illnesses (M\u00f8ller 1940).\n\n     A changeling comes about when trolls steal a newborn human child and replace it with one of their own. This switch can only take place before the child is baptized. In some stories, the changeling is shown to be quite old. Frequently, the explicit motivation for the changing is the desire of the troll mother to have her child baptized, thus guaranteeing the troll child salvation (and depriving the human child of the same).\n\n     Sewing crosses, or otherwise using Christian iconography in the house, over or in the infant's bed, or on the infant's clothes were broadly considered efficacious against the threat of being switched. The loss of a child could have significant impact on a rural family, particularly if the child, because of its \"changed\" shape (e.g. deformity or mental deficiency) could not contribute to the economy of the farm. The danger was that the child, rather than assisting in domestic chores, small farming tasks, and later offering his parents a retirement (aft\u00e6gt) arrangement, would be a constant drain on the household economy. In the worst case, the changeling might force the family into the care of the parish poverty assistance administration.\n\n      The switch to narrative from shorter rhymes and descriptions of folk belief suggests that Peder had \"warmed up\" and was now ready to tell more stories.

In all of these cases, people assume the form of an animal; these creatures are usually most active at night. The close connection between mares and werewolves is further attested in numerous legends (DS II F 62).\n\n     The mare climbs on top of people or horses at night and \"rides\" them (KMP 1.37; DS II F 93-95) (Raudvere 1993). The victims usually suffer greatly and in some stories, die. There are some accounts of the mare riding plows, a belief that links the mare to the Wandering Jew (DS II F 106; KMP 2.02). The mare's actions take direct aim at the physical and economic well-being of the farm.\n\n     Belief in the mare is related to the English word nightmare. In Danish, the word for a bad dream is mareridt or, literally, \"mare ridden.\"\n\n     There are numerous strategies for dealing with the mare--often these strategies include Christian symbolism, such as the use of crosses. The best known \"cross\" for the mare is the marekors, an eight-pointed star, drawn in one continuous stroke (DS II F 90; KMP 1.37). Pouring water on the mare would usually stop the riding and reveal the mare's true identity (DS II F 73). Other stories tell of trapping the mare (DS II F 65). Turning one's clogs is also a well known prophylactic against the mare climbing into one's bed. The efficacy of this relies on the inversion of the clogs since the inverted status of the supernatural can be counteracted by another inversion.\n\n     The use of threshing knives, or other sharp objects, to catch and punish the mare is also widely attested (DS II F 54). The ensuing injury to the mare appears on the body of the person who transforms into the mare at night. This mode of capturing (and punishing) the mare is similar to various strategies for revealing the identity of a witch in hare's form, or the witch who rides a person to the witches' Sabbath. This last phenomenon is closely related to the phenomenon of being ridden by the mare.\n\n     Peder's suggestion that a person who is a mare has eyebrows that grow together over their nose is widely attested (DS II F 50). It is also known as a characteristic of people who are werewolves (DS II F 8).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en te M\u00e5ren red og han var s. meget\nslem ved ham og de laaste og de skaadede\nmen M\u00e5ren gik derind allig.

Exceptional personal gain was, in a limited good model, seen as coming at the expense of others (Foster 1959). Making a pact with the devil would guarantee wealth, but it would also underscore one's willingness to transgress the boundaries of the human community for personal gain. \n\n     Not surprisingly, the main character in stories about pacts with the devil often come from the wealthy classes: merchants and large land owners. The stories may act as a form of narrative revenge, chipping away at the power and prestige of the wealthy by telling stories of their unholy alliances. The resolution of these stories usually consists of the main human character's grisly death, a fitting punishment for eschewing god and, by extension, the community. \n\n     Peder's story includes an interesting interlude in which Lavst tricks the devil. In many variants, the person who tricks the devil is a wise minister. Leaving something undone--in this case, his stockings--is a common ruse. Other tricks include asking to wait until a candle burns down, and then extinguishing it (DS VI 95), or asking to be allowed to put on one's clothes, and then leaving a button undone (DS VI 87). The ruse, however, only lasts so long, and Lavst eventually has to make good on his side of the bargain. \n\n     The merchant class was conservative. In the st\u00e6nderforsamling (local assemblies) and later in the Rigsdag (parliament), the merchants from the market towns generally supported the policies of the urban mercantilists, the civil servants and the large land owners. This political stance was in direct opposition to that of the rural farming and cotter class. It is not surprising, then, that Peder would tell a story in which a stalwart of the merchant class turns out to be in league with the devil.\n\n     Peder's story of a pact with the devil is somewhat unusual in the precise attention to detail in his description of Satan. In many stories, Satan is personified (as he is in the Bible) (Valk 2001). The description of a thin-faced man in black with a long cape, with a long mustache and pointy beard is in line with other descriptions of Satan. In other legends, he is also described as having horns and cloven feet (DS VI 471; DS VI 478).\n\n      The description of Satan's carriage is also typical. A lone traveler in a carriage pulled by two black horses suggests significant wealth. The glowing wheels are at once ominous and suggestive of extraordinary speed. The speed of the devil's travel is confirmed by the short time it takes him to reach Skanderborg, meet with Lavst Thomsen and return.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en M. i Skanderb. L.

Witches are an insidious threat to a community, since they come from within. In many stories, witches steal milk from the neighbors' cows after turning themselves into a hare (DS  VII 106), or by using sticks or other mundane objects (DS VII 584; DS VII 592). There was a strong belief that witches taught their children, particularly their daughters, how to be witches as well. \n\n     By the end of the nineteenth century, accusations of witchcraft had lost much of the legal power that they had had in the seventeenth century when proof of witchcraft could lead to a death sentence.

The count approaches Kristen with the proposition of a paid fight, although the implication is that the count views the fight almost as if it were part of Kristen's villeinage. Kristen knows he has the upper hand in this negotiation, and repeats the common complaint of farm workers that he is neither fed well enough nor housed well enough (PJ 2.26). \n\n     Unlike most aristocrats, the count turns out to be quite generous, interested only in the (Danish) victory, and offers to pay Kristen the proceeds from the bet. In other variants, the bet is smaller (JAH II 412) or the pay out is forgiveness of Kristen's outstanding farm debt (JAH II 414). This latter version has Kristen then entering the newly emergent class of smallholders, a significant change in status for him. In this context, it is worth noting that Kristen only gains his financial independence through a game of chance; despite strength, and obvious prowess on the farm as attested in the second story, Kristen would not otherwise have a chance to earn the money necessary to become independent. The story can be read as a rather depressing commentary on the structure of the Danish rural economy.\n\n      The victory of the Danish strongman over the English strongman likely reflects the bitterness that Danes still felt over the defeat of the Danish navy and the bombardment of Copenhagen by the Brits in 1807. The subsequent downward spiral of the Danish kingdom in European politics and trade still resonated throughout Denmark up through the nineteenth century. Against a backdrop of repeated setbacks to an army composed almost entirely of peasants, including resounding defeat at the hands of the English and the Prussians, a victory of a Danish farmhand over an English strongman must have had clear appeal.\n\n     In another variant of this story, told by J. Jensen from Refshaleg\u00e5rd, the count is identified as the lord at Frisenborg (Frijsenborg) (JA II 412). Frisenborg is approximately four kilometers north-east of Voldby. The farms at Voldby, prior to the partitioning of fields, would have belonged to Frisenborg. Tang Kristensen includes this identification of the count in Peder's story even though it does not appear in the manuscript.\n\n     The grevskab (countship) at Frisenborg was established in 1672, and included lands valued at 22,000 barrels of hartkorn, spread across four districts (amt). It was the largest estate in Denmark at the time. In the 1860s, the count, a konseilspr\u00e6sident and accordingly a politically powerful figure (as a senior member of the parliament), rebuilt the main building. The farm is still privately held by Count Bent Wedell. In the mid twentieth century, his father acquired through marriage another manor farm, Wedellsborg, in western Fyn. The holdings now play a major role in Danish agriculture and forestry.\n\n     Tang Kristensen made minor changes in the published version, particularly in the short, humorous story at the end, deleting Kristen's direct speech. Perhaps Tang Kristensen wanted to paint a picture of Kristen as a man of few words.", "danish_manuscript": "Kristen S\u00f8 han kunde tage Hammel Kirkeklok\nke og staa og ringe imellem hans Ben, og den\nvar endda saadan at der skulde 6 Karle til\nat mure den op i Tallev\u00e6rk da de var\nf\u00e6rdige ved at mure.

They succeeded too and since that time Gravold has been deserted and was never rebuilt. It wasn't R. Jonsen, the one, they didn't recognize each other when they met up. They did it on Christmas Eve because that was when the farms were guarded the least and people sat around drinking.", "danish_publication": "Norden og \u00f8sten for Sofiendal, der oppe efter, hvor Gammelgaard nu ligger og i N\u00e6rheden af den S\u00f8, de kalte Pittes\u00f8en, men som nu er udt\u00f8rret, har der ligget en Gaard, som kaldtes Gravold, og der skal v\u00e6re Rester at se af den endnu. Den Gaard har efter gammel Snak v\u00e6ret ejet af denher Ranild Jons\u00f8n, vi nok har h\u00f8rt om. Ved den s\u00f8ndre Side af Mos S\u00f8 laa forhen ogsaa en Herregaard, og de to Gaarde blev lagt \u00f8de paa samme Tid. Herom fort\u00e6lles, at de to Herrem\u00e6nd fejdede med hinanden, og saa besluttede de hver paa sin Side at stikke Ild paa hinandens Gaarde. Det skulde ske Julenat, for da var Gaardene mindst bevogtede, for det Folkene sad og drak og holdt sig lystige, og det var jo m\u00e6rkeligt nok, at de begge to fik den Beslutning den samme Nat og saa drog af og m\u00f8dtes hver fra sin Side ved Enden af Mos S\u00f8 her ved Fuldbro M\u00f8lle. De kjendte ikke hinanden og drog videre og fik ogsaa Held af at faa hinandens Gaarde stukket i Brand. Da de nu kom hjem enhver til sit, laa deres Gaarde i Aske.

According to old talk, this farm was owned by this Ranild J\u00f8nson we\u2019ve heard quite a bit about. On the southern side of Mos Lake there was another manor farm, and these two farms were decimated at the same time. They say that the two manor lords feuded with each other, and so they each decided to burn the other one's farm. It was to happen Christmas eve, since on that night, the farms would be guarded the least, because people sat about drinking and enjoying themselves and it was kind of strange that these two made the same decision to attack on the same night, and then they went off and met up, each coming from their own way around Mos Lake down here at Fuldbro mill. They didn\u2019t recognize each other and continued on their way and were also lucky enough to set each other's farms on fire. Now when they each got home to their own place, their farms lay in ashes. Since that time, both Gravold and the other farm have been deserted."}, {"story_id": 432, "full_name": "123 - 4.04 - JFm_XIII_38", "publication_info": "JFm_XIII_38", "annotation": "Peder's folktales often focus on the remarkable deeds of a farmhand who, through quick wit and remarkably lax morals that border on sociopathic behavior, is able to get ahead. This tale, a variant of ATU 650a, \"Strong John\", is no exception. \n\n     The story is broken into two distinct parts, although both parts are integral to the tale. The first part focuses on the strong boy and his conflict with his employer. Hans's unusual birth from a goose egg incubated by a beggar (it would be hard to imagine being lower status than that), is not uncommon in such tales. The story then proceeds in a manner that is reminiscent of Peder's other story of dangerous young men (PJ 1.02 and 2.27). One also finds echoes of motifs from some of his legends, in particular the stories about the strong farmhands, Kristen S\u00f8 (PJ 3.18) and Svend Felding (PJ 2.03). \n\n      Hans's actions are remarkably destructive, and the economic as well as physical survival of the farm is clearly in doubt. Hans's extraordinary ability to work, and the extreme nature of his reactions, parallels the nisse, a figure that also figures in Peder's repertoire (PJ 2.03, 2.11, 2.21-22, 3.07). While having a strong farmhand is usually an asset, here it is a clear liability (PJ 2.03).\n\n     In many ATU 650a tales, the employer only tries to kill the boy once, usually with a millstone. Peder expands the story to include a lengthy journey to visit the devil. The magical helper, the hermit, is dead when Hans passes by--Hans's compassionate treatment of the helper even in death signals a shift in the character from his earlier marked selfishness. \n\n     When Hans finally returns to the manor farm, the devil calls in the debt that Hans had acquired for the manor lord. In short, Hans enters into a pact with the devil with the two souls of the manor lord and his wife as payment (PJ 3.08). Because of the unusual structure of this agreement, Hans is able to take over the manor farm. Interestingly, Hans's rise from low level to high level is not accompanied with marriage to a high level young female, the usual pattern for an active masculine tale (Holbek 1987). This omission is interesting in light of Peder's own lifelong status as a bachelor.\n\n     The story is indexed in the fair copy collection as \u00c6v 1967. The published version differs only slightly from the manuscript recording.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en gl. Mand h. gik og tiggede\nsom Skik og Brug var. gl. Dage.

So he goes in to one place and they didn't have anything for him except for a very large goose egg. So he takes it and goes his way. Now he thought that it would be nice to get that egg hatched. He could probably do it himself. Now I've begged for a long time so I can certainly handle lying and resting while I take care of this. Well, then he lay for a while, and something came of it, but it turned out to be a boy. The man wasn't terribly proud of this, but there was nothing else to do but to see that the boy stayed alive. He was one who wanted to thrive and he ate quite a bit, and so it wasn't long before he could carry both everything that he could beg and everything that the old man could beg as well. Well, at some point this here old man made sure that the boy was baptized and had him named Hans, because that's what he was called himself, and so he thought he wanted to have someone named after him. Finally, he got him work with a farmer, and he was to take care of the geese, but that didn't work out because he didn't treat them gently and he killed them, then he lost his job, and so the old man had him once again. He says to him: You're to go up and work for the manor lord since he is quite brusque, and he can thrash you. He goes up to the manor lord with the lad and says such and such, he couldn't have him work anywhere, and would he please take him. Yes, the manor lord was quite happy with him, because nobody would stay there, he chased them away as soon as they came; he could do as he pleased. He goes up there one holiday in the afternoon, and so there wasn't anything to do then, so he was shown his lodgings, a bed out by the other farmhands. The next morning they go in for breakfast, and he is to be assigned his work and the manor lord says he is to go and thresh because it was at the end of the harvest. He couldn't do anything with his flail since it was far too small, and he goes in and complains about this. OK, you can go ahead and make one for yourself. Hans stood threshing there in the barn (hovlade), where it was quite high to the roof peak, and so there was lots of space, and so then he goes over to a little house they had, and tears a bunch of roof beams off and begins to thresh with that. After he has threshed for three days, the manor lord felt that the pile was big enough, and then he says but how are we going to clean that pile of grain, little Hans? --That'll be my business, he answered quite arrogantly, I'll take care of it. Then he knocks out all the walls in the barn and shovels the whole pile up to a point, and he climbs up on top and he blows with his behind down into the pile so that the chaff is blown to all the world's corners. He goes in and says that the grain is done. He asks him to carry it up into the attic of the main house. Sure, but I'll need some sacks to carry it up in. Sure, here were some sacks. Is it little scraps like this that I'm to carry it in! He goes out and gets hold of a couple of horse blankets or three and he sews them together, and he fills this bag with grain and then he puts it on his shoulders and goes off with it. But the door was too narrow, and he rips it out and makes such an opening that he could go in. Then he throws the sack up in the attic right over their nicest rooms, so it fell through and fell down and ruined all their furnishings. Now the manor lord got scared of him. There's no need to do any more today, you can rest until tomorrow. The other farmhands are going to go out to the forest then and cut and drive the winter firewood home, and you can go along with them, because he thought that there it was more about cleverness than strength, and then he'd have other things to think about. The next morning the other farmhands got up in good time because the roads were rough back then, and it was hard to get a load of firewood loaded and driven home by nightfall and then they say: We're not going to call for Hans, and so they drove out to the forest, because he always finished his work early, and he was going to be the last one today. Hans he gets up when it was a bit later in the day, goes out and has his breakfast. He then hitches up the horses and sets off after the others. When he gets to the forest, he says, yes, you little guys, you think you're going to fool me, but it isn't going to go like that, and then he goes over and pulls up a whole bunch of trees and lays them across the road and plants them firmly. When he gets a little farther in, he meets up with the others, they had already loaded up and were ready to head home. Then they said to him, Well, you'll have to comfort yourself with the fact that the moon is shining, you can certainly find your way home.\" But Hans let them mock him, and then he drove off. He got loaded up in a jiffy, and headed back. They were still standing there and were toiling away to get these trees off the road, and they couldn't get around them with their horses. Hans unhitches his horses from the wagon, leads them around, and lets them stand in front of the trees, goes back around for the wagon and its load, and carries them around to the horses, hitches up again and drives home. Now he'd overloaded his wagon and when he drives in the farm gates, the load gets stuck there. But then he thinks, Now you've got it under roof, let it stand there, he unhitches his horses and goes in and has his dinner. Oh, are the others coming soon? says the manor lord. Yes, it won't be long. The others had to let their loads and their horses stay outside that night, because there was no other entrance to the farm when they finally got there. The next morning, they got up a little earlier than Hans because he wanted to stay in bed a little bit longer and then the manor lord says to them: We need to kill him, or he'll wind up killing us. They were all in agreement, but now the question was how they were going to get rid of him. We'll get rid of him easily, says the manor lord, because as soon as he gets up, we'll have him go down and clean the well, and we have an old millstone lying out there, we'll drop it down on him by accident, and then it'll go that way that he'll be allowed to stay down there. Well, Hans gets up, and the manor lord says to him, Listen, Hans, the water has gone wrong in the well, could you go down and clean it out. The other farmhands can help you and pull the mud up. Sure, there was nothing in the way of doing that. He goes down and begins to dig, and the others haul it up in the bucket. When they've just about cleared out the well, they'd gotten the millstone positioned so that they could easily tickle it down, but they had the misfortune the stone landed next to him without hitting him and then he realized that things were wrong and so he grabbed hold of the eye and put it under his arm and climbed up with it. Then he says to them when he comes up: The next time you want to hit people in the head, you should take better aim than you did this time. If they weren't scared before, they were now. OK, says the manor lord, \"don't be so annoyed, it happened by accident, someone stepped on it. Could you do me a favor and go to Hell and get me a daler? I've heard said that the money that comes from there is supposed to go a long way. Sure, I can do that, but how am I supposed to go about asking directions. You can do that, because all you need to do is ask people you meet where Old Erik lives, they'll know, because the one who rules Hell is called Old Erik. Well, then Hans gets a knapsack and he sets off on his journey. After he has gone a while and asked many people the way -- but of course there was no one who could show him the way, he comes to a really big forest, and he comes to a hermit or one like that, and he asks him as well, if he could tell him where Old Erik lived. Then he says, Yes, I certainly can, because I've shown many people there, but not a one has ever come back. But what do you want there? Well, then he told him his errand. Yes, there's nothing in the way of that, and I'm going to set a ball rolling, and it will keep going until it gets to the gate, and then it will stop. But there are three things that you should watch out for. They'll ask you to sit down when you get in there, but you mustn't do that. Then he'll give you the daler in your hand, but you mustn't let him do that. You can simply say: Oh, please put it on the floor, it needs to cool down a bit, then you can take it. And then you need to watch out when you leave, that you don't step on the threshold, you need to do it in one jump, otherwise your feet will be broken. If you can watch out for those three things and get past them well, then I'll be released (from a curse). Go now in the name of God, says the old man, and then he set the ball rolling, and it started rolling, but it didn't roll any faster than Hans could follow along walking. It was a very even road he was to walk, and there was nothing to hinder him and after a while, the ball stops in front of a large gate, there was a really big slope leading up to it, and it was a big iron gate. He started to pound on it, and then someone came and opened it and asked him what he wanted. Yes, he needed to talk to Old Erik. Oh, OK, and then the gate was opened just enough for him to go through and he got in. Please come in. When he gets in, someone comes up to him, he figured that it was Old Erik. Good day, he says, it is me that they call Old Erik, what is your errand? -- I am to greet you from the manor lord and ask for a daler. -- You can have that but it costs two souls. -- I don't care what it costs, because it isn't me who is to pay. -- OK, you can sit down, it will be done soon. But Hans remembered what he'd been told, and he wouldn't sit. So he stood and looked around, and as far as he could see, the room was so long. There were these devils standing there smithing, he couldn't figure anything else out. A little while later Old Erik comes and hands him a daler and says, Here you are, -- Yes, put it down on the floor a bit, it needs to cool off, it\u2019s quite hot. After he thought it had lain a while, he took it and put it in his pocket. Yes, now I'd like the door opened. Sure, that was possible, and the gate was opened and Hans took a huge jump out, and the gate was slammed so hard that it echoed. Then he heard someone shout after him: You don't have your wisdom from yourself, otherwise we'd have gotten you. But Hans didn't worry about that, he kept walking. After he's gone a little bit, he notices that the ball has started rolling ahead of him again, and it kept going until it came to the hermit's cave. I should go in there and thank him for the good information. He lay there and was dead. So for his help Hans took him and buried him, since he thought he'd earned it, and after that he went home to the manor farm. When he gets closer to it, the bailiff comes out and sees him and he goes back as fast as he knows how. Well, now we have Hans again. What do we have says the manor lord, and out of sheer nervousness and fright for Hans he jumps down into the well, and dies there and when his wife hears that, she gets  hold of a rope and hangs herself. When Hans comes in through the gate, he meets Old Erik, who says: Yes, now I'm taking what is mine, Hans, now you can take what's left. In that way Hans became a manor lord.", "danish_publication": "Der var en gammel Mand, han gik omkring og tiggede, som Skik og Brug var i gamle Dage. Saa kommer han ind et Sted, og der havde de ikke andet, end de giver ham et v\u00e6ldig stort Gaase\u00e6g. Saa tager han jo det og gaar hans Vej. Nu tykte han, det var rart at faa det \u00c6g ruget ud, og det maatte han Vist selv kunne gj\u00f8re. \"Nu har a tigget nok sammen for lange Tider, a kan sku godt taale at ligge og hvile mig, imens a faar det bes\u00f8rget.\" Naa, saa laa han jo hans Tid, og der kom da ogsaa noget ud af det, og det blev en Dreng. Manden var ikke saa meget stolt af dether, men der var jo ikke andet for, end han skulde n\u00f8des til at s\u00f8rge for at holde Liv i Drengen. Det var da ogsaa \u00e9n, der var nogen Trivning i, og han trak godt fra, saa det varede ikke l\u00e6nge, inden han kunde b\u00e6re baade det, han kunde selv tigge, og det, den gamle kunde tigge ogsaa. Naa, denher gamle Mand han S\u00f8rgede omsider for at faa Drengen d\u00f8bt og lod ham kalde Hans, for saadan hed han selv, og saa tykte han, han vilde kaldes op, ellers blev det vel aldrig gjort. Endelig omsider, da Drengen var vogset noget til, fik han ham da sat i Tjeneste ved en Bonde, og han skulde passe Gj\u00e6ssene. Men det kunde ikke gaa, for han omgikkes dem ikke lempelig og slog de fleste af dem ihjel. Saa kom han af Tjenesten, og saa havde den gamle ham igjen. Han siger saa til ham: \"Du skal op at tjene ved Herremanden, han er nu ellers saa brysk, og saa kan han komme til at t\u00e6rske paa dig.\" Han gaar saa op til Herremanden med Kn\u00e6gten og siger saadan og saadan, han kunde ingen Steder have ham, \"og I maa v\u00e6re saa god at tage ham.\" Ja, Herremanden var jo glad ved ham, for han kunde ingen Folk have, de blev jaget v\u00e6k, lige saa saare de snart var komne; men denher Kn\u00e6gt kunde han gj\u00f8re ved, ligesom han vilde. Han kommer i Tjenesten en Helligdag om Eftermiddagen, og da Skulde der jo ikke bestilles noget. Saa fik han hans Kvarter anvist ude i en Seng ved de andre Karle, og anden Dags Morgen de kommer ind til Davre, kommer Herremanden og skal til at anvise ham hans Arbejde: han skal ud at t\u00e6rske, for det var sidst om H\u00f8sten. Han kommer ogsaa ud i Laden, men det kunde ikke blive til noget med hans plejlt\u00f8j, for det var altfor smaat, og han gaar ind og klager over dether. \"Ja, saa kan du jo selv lave dig noget,\" siger Herremanden. Hans stod og tarsk i Hovladen, hvor der var langt op til M\u00f8nnen, saa der var ellers god plads, og saa gaar han hen til et bitte Hus, de havde, og river et Kobbel Sp\u00e6nder af og giver sig til at knokle paa Kornet med det. Da han har saa torsken en 3 Dags Tid, tykte Herremanden at Dyngen var stor nok, og saa siger han: \"Men hvordan skal vi faa den Dynge Korn gjort ren, bitte Hans?\" \u2014 \"Det bliver min Sag,\" svarte han nok saa profos, \"a skal nok bes\u00f8rge det.\" Saa slaar han alle V\u00e6ggene ud af Laden og skovler Dyngen op i en Tip, og der s\u00e6tter han sig oppe i Tippen og bl\u00e6ser med Enden ned i Dyngen, saa Avnerne styver til alle Verdens Hj\u00f8rner. Derefter gaar han ind og m\u00e6lder, te nu er Kornet f\u00e6rdigt. Herremanden beder ham saa om at b\u00e6re det op paa Loftet i Salsen. \"Ja, saa skulde a jo have nogle S\u00e6kke at b\u00e6re det op i.\" Ja, her var S\u00e6kke. \"Er det saadan nogle Stumper, a skal b\u00e6re Kornet i!\" siger Hans, og saa gaar han ud og faar fat i et Par D\u00e6kkener eller tre, og dem syer han Sammen, saa der bliver en stor rummelig Pose. Den \u00f8ser han fuld af Korn, og saa faar han den paa Nakken og rejser af med den. Men D\u00f8ren var for smal, og han river den da ud og gj\u00f8r saadan Aabning, at han kan komme ind. Saa smider han S\u00e6kken op paa Loftet og hen over deres allerp\u00e6neste Stuer, te den faldt igjennem og faldt ned og Spolerede dem alt deres Boskab.\n     Nu blev Herremanden lige godt r\u00e6d for ham. \"Nu er det ikke v\u00e6rd at bestille mere i Dag,\" siger han, \"nu kan du hvile dig til i Morgen. Da skal de andre Karle i Skoven at skove og have Vinterbr\u00e6ndselet kj\u00f8rt hjem, og saa kan du f\u00f8lge  med,\" for her t\u00e6nkte han, det gjaldt mere om Beh\u00e6ndighed end om Kr\u00e6fter, og saa fik han vel andet at studere paa. Om Morgenen rejste de andre Karle dem i god Tid, for det var seje Veje, vi havde den Tid, og det kneb med at faa et L\u00e6s Br\u00e6ndsel skovet og kj\u00f8rt hjem til Aften. Saa siger de: \"Nu vil vi ikke kalde paa Hans!\" for han var altid saa tidlig f\u00e6rdig med hans Arbejde, og nu havde de overlagt, at han skulde v\u00e6re den sidste i Dag. Saa kj\u00f8rte de til Skovs, og da det var bleven lidt op ad Dagen, rejser Hans sig og faar hans Davre. Han faar saa T\u00f8jet paa B\u00e6sterne og kommer af Sted ud efter de andre. Da han kommer ind ad Skoven, siger han: \"Ja, bitte Karle, I t\u00e6nker, I skal narre mig, men det skal nu ikke gaa saadan til, som I forestiller jer,\" og saa gaar han hen og rykker en hel Hoven Tr\u00e6er op og l\u00e6gger tv\u00e6rt over Vejen bag ved sig. Saa kj\u00f8rer han fort, og da han kommer noget l\u00e6ngere ind, saa m\u00f8des han med de andre, de havde allerede faaet l\u00e6sset og skulde til at hjem. Saa sagde de til ham: \"Ja, du faar jo at tr\u00f8ste dig med, at det er maanelyst, saa du kan sagt redde dig hjem i Aften.\" Men Hans lod dem spotte, og saa kj\u00f8rte han. Han fik l\u00e6sset i en Haandevending og kom afsted tilbage. Der stod de endnu og asnede og sled for at faa deher Tr\u00e6er af Vejen, og kunde ikke komme frem med deres B\u00e6ster. Hans han sp\u00e6nder hans B\u00e6ster fra Vognen, tr\u00e6kker dem uden om og lader dem staa forved Tr\u00e6erne, gaar saa om efter Vognen og L\u00e6sset og b\u00e6rer det om til B\u00e6sterne, sp\u00e6nder saa for igjen og kj\u00f8rer Hjem. Nu havde han lige godt faaet l\u00e6sset for haardt, for da han kj\u00f8rer ind gjennem Porten, kj\u00f8rer han L\u00e6sset fast der. Men saa t\u00e6nker han: \"Nu har du jo faaet det under Tag, lad det saa staa,\" og han sp\u00e6nder fra og gaar ind og faar hans N\u00e6tter. \"Naa, kommer de andre snart?\" siger Herremanden. \"Ja, det kan ikke vare l\u00e6nge,\" siger Hans. De andre maatte lade deres Vogne og Heste blive ude den Nat, for der var ikke andre Indgang paa Gaarden end gjennem Porten, og den var jo sp\u00e6rret.\n     Hans vilde gj\u00e6rne ligge lidt l\u00e6nge om Morgenen, og anden Dagen var Folkene som s\u00e6dvanlig noget tidlig paa Benene, skj\u00f8ndt de ikke havde faaet megen S\u00f8vn den Nat. Saa siger Herremanden til dem: \"Vi skal have den Karl kv\u00e6ld, heller ogsaa kv\u00e6ler han os.\" Det var de ogsaa godt enige med ham om, men nu var det om, hvordan de skulde komme afsted med det. \"Ja, det skal vi komme nemt afsted med,\" siger Herremanden, \"for n\u00e6renstid han kommer nu op, saa lader vi ham gaa ned og rydde Kjelden, og saa har vi en gammel M\u00f8llesten, der ligger der henne, den trimler vi ned paa ham, saadan af Vanvare, saa skal det nok gaa saadan, han faar Lov til at blive der nede.\" Naa, da Hans kommer op, saa siger Herremanden til ham: \"H\u00f8r, Hans, Vandet er blevet galt i Kjelden, du kunde vel ikke gaa ned og rydde den. De andre Karle kan hj\u00e6lpe dig og tr\u00e6kke T\u00f8jet op.\" Jo, det var der intet i Vejen for. Han gaar ned og begynder at grave op, og de andre hejser op i Spanden. Da de har faa faaet Kjelden saadan omtrent ryddet, havde de faaet den M\u00f8llesten lagt saadan, at de kunde nemt pirre den derned, men havde lige godt det Uheld, at Stenen gik ned ved Siden af ham, uden at komme til at slaa ham. Saa m\u00e6rkede han jo godt, det var galt, og saa tog han fat i \u00d8jet paa Stenen og tog den under Armen og assenserede op med den. Saa siger han til dem, da han kom op: \"N\u00e6renstid I vil slaa Folk den i Hovedet, saa skal I tage bedre Sigte, end I gjorde denher Gang.\" Hvad de var ikke r\u00e6dde, saa blev de det nu.\n     \"Ja,\" siger Herremanden, \"du kommer til ikke at tage det fortrydeligt op, for det Skete af Vanvare, der kom \u00e9n til at tr\u00e6de paa den. Kunde du nu ikke have gjort mig den Tjeneste, at gaa til Hellede og hente en Daler til mig. A har h\u00f8rt sige af de penge, der kommer derfra, de skal v\u00e6re saa dr\u00f8je.\" \u2014 \"Jo, det kan a nok, men hvordan skal a b\u00e6re mig ad med at sp\u00f8rge Vej dertil.\" \u2014 \"Det kan du sagt, for du beh\u00f8ver blot at sp\u00f8rge dem, du kommer til, hvor Gamle-Erik boer, saa v\u00e9d de nok det, for han hedder Gamle-Erik, der regjerer i Hellede.\"\n     Naa, saa fik Hans sig jo en Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k standet, og han kommer paa Vandring. Da han har saa gaaet et St\u00f8d og spurgt flere om Vej \u2014 men der var naturligvis ingen, der kunde vise ham den, saa kommer han ind i en v\u00e6ldig stor Skov, og der kommer han til en Eremit eller saadan en \u00e9n, og ham sp\u00f8rger han jo da ogsaa, om han kunde ikke Sige ham, hvor Gamle-Erik han boede. \"Jo,\" siger han, \"det kan a godt, for a har vist mange Mennesker dertil, men der er aldrig \u00e9n kommen tilbage. Men hvad vil du der?\" Ja, saa fortalte han ham jo hans \u00c6rende, og han vilde nok dertil, saa Snart ske kunde. \"Ja, det er der ikke noget i Vejen for, nu skal a s\u00e6tte en Kugle i Gang, og saa bliver den ved, til den kommer til Porten, saa stopper den. Du f\u00f8lger jo efter den, men saa er der tre Ting, du maa passe paa. De vil nu byde dig, du skal sidde ned, naar du kommer derind, men det maa du ikke. Saa vil han fly dig Daleren i Haanden, men du maa heller ikke det, du kan blot sige til ham: Aa, l\u00e6g den paa Gulvet, den kan svales lidt. Naar den har ligget der en lidt, saa kan du tage den. Og endelig maa du passe, naar du tr\u00e6der ud af Hellede, at du ikke tr\u00e6der paa D\u00f8rtr\u00e6et, du skal tage det ud af \u00e9t Spring, for ellers faar du F\u00f8dderne slaaet i Stykker. Kan du passe paa de tre Ting og komme godt fra dem, se saa er a forl\u00f8st, og du er frelst for den Gang. Rejs saa i Guds Navn,\" siger den gamle Mand, og saa satte han Kuglen i Gang, og den gav sig til at l\u00f8be, men l\u00f8b ikke st\u00e6rkere, end at Hans kunde f\u00f8lge den i Skridtgang. Det var saadan j\u00e6vn Vej, han havde at gaa, og det tr\u00e6llede jo ikke.\n    Omsider standser Kuglen for en stor Port. Der var en v\u00e6ldig stor Skraaning op til den, og det var en stor J\u00e6rnport. Den gav Hans sig til at hamre paa, og saa kom der \u00e9n og lukkede op og spurgte om, hvad han vilde. Ja, han skulde snakke med Gamle-Erik. Naa ja, saa blev Porten lukket op, saa han kunde lige gaa igjennem, og saadan kom han ind. \"V\u00e6rsgod og kom indenfor,\" siger \u00e9n til ham. Da han nu triner videre frem, kommer der ogsaa \u00e9n, det var Gamle-Erik, gjorde han da Regning paa. \"Goddag,\" siger han saa, \"det er mig, de kalder Gamle-Erik, hvad er dit \u00c6rende?\" \u2014 \"Det er, a skulde hilse fra Herremanden og bede om en Daler.\" \u2014 \"Den kan du ogsaa faa,\" siger Gamle-Erik, \"men den koster to Sj\u00e6le.\" \u2014 \"Ja, det er mig lige meget, hvad den koster, for det er ikke mig, der skal betale den.\" \u2014 \"Ja, nu kan du s\u00e6tte dig, saa skal den strags v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdig.\" Men Hans huskede jo paa Buddet, han havde faaet, og han vilde ikke sidde. Saa stod han og saa sig om, og saa langt han kunde se, der var saadan et langt Rum, og der stod deher Dj\u00e6vle og smedede, han kunde da ikke blive klog paa andet. Omsider kommer Gamle-Erik og flyer ham Daleren og siger: \"V\u00e6rsgod, her er den.\" \u2014 \"Ja, l\u00e6g den lidt paa Gulvet, den kan svales,\" siger Hans, \"den er vel varm at tage ved.\" Da den havde ligget lidt, som han tykte, saa tog han den og put den i Lommen. \"Ja, saa vilde a godt have lukket op,\" siger han, \"for nu skal a te'en.\" Jo, det kunde godt lade sig gj\u00f8re, og Porten blev lukket op. Hans tog saa et v\u00e6ldigt Spring ud, og Porten blev hugget i lige te det rungede. Saa h\u00f8rte han \u00e9n, der raabte efter ham: \"Ja, din Klogskab har du ikke af dig selv, ellers skulde vi sku nok have fanget dig.\" Men det br\u00f8d Hans sig ikke om, han blev ved at gaa.\n     Da han er kommen lidt hen, ser han, at Kuglen er kommen til at l\u00f8be forved ham igjen, og den blev ved, indtil den kom til Eremitens Hus. \"Da skal a ind,\" siger Hans til sig selv, \"og sige ham Tak for god Underretning.\" Men da laa han og var d\u00f8d. Saa for udvist Tjeneste tog Hans ham og begravet ham, han tykte, han havde fortjent det, og derefter gik han hjem til Herregaarden. Da han kommer der i N\u00e6rheden, saa kommer Ridefogden ud og faaer ham at se, og han tilbage, det villeste han har l\u00e6rt. \"Saa, nu har vi sku Hans igjen,\" raaber han. \"Hvad har vi!\" siger Herremanden, og af ene Forfippelse og R\u00e6dsel for Hans saa springer han ned i Kjelden og kommer af Dage der. Da hans Kone h\u00f8rer det, saa faar hun fat i en Strikke og gaar hen og h\u00e6nger sig. Da Hans saa kommer ind ad Porten, saa kommer han der imod Gamle-Erik, der siger: \"Ja, nu tager a, hvad mit er; nu kan du, Hans, tage det, der er tilbage.\" Det gjorde Hans ogsaa, og paa den Maade blev han Herremand.", "english_publication": "There was an old man, he went about begging as was the custom in the old days. So he goes in to one place and they didn\u2019t have anything for him except for a very large goose egg. So he takes it and goes his way. Now he thought that it would be nice to get that egg hatched, and he figured he could probably do it himself. \u201cNow I\u2019ve begged for a long time, so I can certainly handle lying and resting while I take care of this.\u201d Well, then he lay for a while, and something came of it, and it turned out to be a boy. The man wasn\u2019t terribly proud of this, but there was nothing else to do but to make sure that the boy stayed alive. The boy was someone who really wanted to thrive, and he ate quite a bit, and so it wasn\u2019t long before he could carry both everything that he could beg and everything that the old man could beg as well. \n     Well, at some point this here old man made sure that the boy was baptized and had him named Hans, because that\u2019s what he was called himself, and so he thought he wanted to have someone named after him, otherwise it would never happen. Finally, when the boy had grown up some, he got him work with a farmer, and he was to take care of the geese. But that didn\u2019t work out because he didn\u2019t treat them gently and he killed most of them. Then he lost his job, and so the old man had him once again. \n     He says to him, \u201cYou\u2019re to go up and work for the manor lord, he is quite brusque, and he might go as far as to thrash you.\u201d He goes up to the manor lord with the lad and says such and such, he couldn\u2019t get him work anywhere, \u201cand would you please take him.\u201d Yes, the manor lord was quite happy to take him, because nobody else would stay there, he chased them away as soon as they came; but he could do as he pleased with this lad.\n     The boy starts work one holiday in the afternoon, and so there wasn\u2019t anything to do then. So he was shown his lodgings, a bed out by the other farmhands, and the next morning when they\u2019ve come in for breakfast, the manor lord comes in to show him his work: he is to go and thresh, because it was at the end of the harvest. \n     He goes out to the barn too, but he couldn\u2019t do anything with his flail, since it was far too small, and he goes in and complains about this. \u201cOK, you can go ahead and make one for yourself,\u201d says the manor lord. Hans stood threshing there in the barn where it was quite high to the roof peak, and so there was lots of space, and so then he goes over to a little house they had, and tears a bunch of roof beams off and begins to thresh the grain with that. After he has threshed for three days, the manor lord felt that the pile was big enough, and then he says: \u201cBut how are we going to clean that pile of grain, little Hans?\u201d\u2014\u201cThat\u2019ll be my business,\u201d he answered quite arrogantly, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Then he knocks out all the walls in the barn and shovels the whole pile up to a point, and he climbs up on top and he blows with his behind down into the pile so that the chaff is blown to all the world\u2019s corners. After that he goes in and says that the grain is done. The manor lord then asks him to carry it up into the attic of the main house. \u201cSure, but I\u2019ll need some sacks to carry it up in.\u201d Sure, here were some sacks. \u201cIs it little scraps like this that I\u2019m to carry the grain in?\u201d Hans says, and then he goes out and gets hold of a couple of horse blankets or three and he sews them together, so it becomes a big roomy bag. He fills it with grain and then he puts it on his shoulders and goes off with it. But the door was too narrow, and he rips it out and makes such an opening that he could go in. Then he throws the sack up in the attic and over their nicest rooms, and then it fell through and fell down and ruined all their furnishings. \n     Now the manor lord got scared of him. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do any more today,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can rest until tomorrow. The other farmhands are going to go out to the forest then and cut and drive the winter firewood home, and you can go along with them,\u201d because he thought that that was more about cleverness than strength, and then he\u2019d have other things to think about. The next morning the other farmhands got up in good time, because it was rough roads we had back then, and it was hard to get a load of firewood loaded and driven home by nightfall. Then they say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to call for Hans!\u201d because he always finished his work early, and now they\u2019d decided that he\u2019d be the last one today. So they drove out to the forest, and when it was later in the day, Hans gets up and has his breakfast. He then hitches up the horses and sets off after the others. When he gets to the forest, he says, \u201cYes, you little guys, you think you\u2019re going to fool me, but it isn\u2019t going to go the way you think,\u201d and then he goes over and pulls up a whole bunch of trees and lays them across the road behind himself. Then he drives quickly, and when he gets a little farther in, he meets up with the other farmhands, they had already loaded up and were ready to head home. Then they said to him, \u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to comfort yourself with the fact that the moon is shining, you can certainly find your way home tonight.\u201d But Hans let them mock him, and then he drove off. He got loaded up in a jiffy and headed back. They were still standing there and were toiling away to get these trees off the road, and they couldn\u2019t get around them with their horses. Hans unhitches his horses from the wagon, leads them around, and lets them stand in front of the trees, goes back around for the wagon and its load, and carries them around to the horses, hitches up again and drives home. Now he\u2019d overloaded his wagon and when he drives in the farm gates, the load gets stuck there. But then he thinks, \u201cNow you\u2019ve got it under roof, let it stand there,\u201d so he unhitches his horses and goes in and has his dinner. \u201cOh, are the others coming soon?\u201d says the manor lord. \u201cYes, it won\u2019t be long,\u201d says Hans. The others had to let their loads and their horses stay outside that night, because there was no other entrance to the farm than through the gate, and it was blocked.\n     Hans wanted to stay in bed a little bit longer in the morning, and the next day the people were on their feet early as usual, even though they hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep that night. Then the manor lord says to them, \u201cWe need to kill that guy, or he\u2019ll wind up killing us.\u201d They were all in agreement, but now the question was how they were going to get rid of him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get rid of him easily,\u201d says the manor lord, \u201cbecause as soon as he gets up, we\u2019ll have him go down and clean the well, and we have an old millstone lying out there, we\u2019ll tumble it down on top of him, you know, by accident, and then he\u2019ll be allowed to stay down there.\u201d Well, Hans gets up, and the manor lord says to him, \u201cListen, Hans, the water has gone wrong in the well, could you go down and clean it out. The other farmhands can help you and pull the mud up.\u201d Sure, there was nothing in the way of doing that. He goes down and begins to dig, and the others haul it up in the bucket. When they\u2019ve just about cleared out the well, they\u2019d gotten the millstone positioned so that they could easily tickle it down on top of him, but they had the misfortune that the stone landed next to him without hitting him. Then Hans realized that things were wrong and so he grabbed hold of the eye of the stone and put it under his arm and climbed up with it. Then he says to them when he comes up: \u201cThe next time you want to hit people in the head, you should take better aim than you did this time.\u201d If they weren\u2019t scared before, they were now.\n     \u201cOK,\u201d says the manor lord, \u201cdon\u2019t be so annoyed, it happened by accident, someone stepped on it. Could you do me a favor and go to hell and get me a daler? I\u2019ve heard said that the money that comes from there is supposed to go a long way.\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, I can do that, but how am I supposed to go about asking directions.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou can do that, because all you need to do is ask people you meet where Old Erik lives, they\u2019ll know, because the one who rules Hell is called Old Erik.\u201d\n     Well, then Hans gets a knapsack and he sets off on his journey. After he has gone a while and asked many people the way \u2013 but of course there was no one who could show him the way \u2013 he comes to a really big forest, and he comes to a hermit or one like that, and he asks him as well, if he could tell him where Old Erik lived. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cI certainly can, because I\u2019ve shown many people there, but not a one has ever come back. But what do you want there?\u201d Well, then he told him his errand, and he wanted to go there as quickly as possible. \u201cYes, there\u2019s nothing in the way of that, and I\u2019m going to set a ball rolling, and it will keep going until it gets to the gate, and then it will stop. You\u2019re to follow it, but there are three things that you should watch out for. They\u2019ll ask you to sit down when you get in there, but you mustn\u2019t do that. Then he\u2019ll give you the daler in your hand, but you mustn\u2019t let him do that, you can simply say: Oh, please put it on the floor, it needs to cool down a bit. When it has lain for a bit, then you can take it. And finally, you need to watch out when you leave hell, that you don\u2019t step on the threshold, you need to do it in one jump, otherwise your feet will be broken. If you can watch out for those three things and get past them well, then I\u2019ll be released from a curse, and you\u2019ll be saved this time. Go now in the name of God,\u201d says the old man, and then he set the ball rolling, and it started rolling, but it didn\u2019t roll any faster than Hans could follow along walking. It was a very even road he was to walk, and there was nothing to hinder him. \n     After a while, the ball stops in front of a large gate. There was a real slope leading up to it, and it was a big iron gate. Hans started to pound on it, and then someone came and opened it and asked him what he wanted. Yes, he needed to talk to Old Erik. Oh, OK, and then the gate was opened just enough for him to go through and that\u2019s how he got in. \u201cPlease come in,\u201d someone says to him. As he goes farther along, someone comes up to him, he figured that it was Old Erik. \u201cGood day,\u201d he says, \u201cit is me that they call Old Erik, what is your errand?\u201d \u2013 \u201cI am to greet you from the manor lord and ask for a daler.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou can have that,\u201d says Old Erik, \u201cbut it costs two souls.\u201d \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t care what it costs, because it isn\u2019t me who is going to pay.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOK, you can sit down, it will be done soon.\u201d But Hans remembered what he\u2019d been told, and he wouldn\u2019t sit. So he stood and looked around, and as far as he could see, the room was so long, there were these devils standing there smithing, he couldn\u2019t figure anything else out. A little while later Old Erik comes and hands him a daler and says, \u201cHere you are,\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, put it down on the floor a bit, it needs to cool off,\u201d says Hans, \u201cit\u2019s too hot to hold.\u201d After he thought it had lain a while, he took it and put it in his pocket. \u201cYes, now I\u2019d like the door opened,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause now I need to go back to someone.\u201d Sure, that was possible, and the gate was opened. Hans took a huge jump out, and the gate was slammed shut so hard behind him that it echoed. Then he heard someone shout after him: \u201cYou don\u2019t have your wisdom from yourself, otherwise we\u2019d have gotten you.\u201d But Hans didn\u2019t worry about that, he kept walking. \n     After he\u2019s gone a little bit, he notices that the ball has started rolling ahead of him again, and it kept going until it came to the hermit\u2019s house. \u201cI should go in there,\u201d says Hans to himself, \u201cand thank him for the good information.\u201d But then the hermit lay there dead. So for his help Hans took him and buried him, since he thought he\u2019d earned it, and after that he went home to the manor farm. When he gets closer to it, the bailiff comes out and sees him and he goes back as fast as he knows how. \u201cWell, now we have Hans again,\u201d he shouts. \u201cWhat do we have?\u201d says the manor lord, and out of sheer nervousness and fright for Hans he jumps down into the well and dies there. When his wife hears that, she gets hold of a rope and hangs herself. When Hans comes in through the gate, he meets Old Erik, who says: \u201cYes, now I\u2019m taking what is mine; now you, Hans, can take what\u2019s left.\" Hans did that too, and in that way he became a manor lord."}, {"story_id": 433, "full_name": "123 - 4.05 - DSnr_IV_657", "publication_info": "DSnr_IV_657", "annotation": "Peder is fascinated by conflict and the ability of the little guy to triumph over the powerful. Here, the postal carrier is a representative of the Crown, and presumably sees himself above the law. The tension between the desire for local control and the role of the central administration (first the Crown and then the state) were constant, and informed a great deal of the debate over legislation concerning local rights through the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\n     One of the main forms of public transportation in Denmark, prior to the development of the railway system in the 1860s, was the system of postal wagons. In fact, carrying passengers was as much a part of the postal service as carrying mail (Hvidt and Olsen 1990, vol. 11). \n\n     The district bailiff, reluctant at first, finally comes to the help of the local man. The willingness to let bygones be bygones might well be related to the tension that existed between the local government and the distant central authority of the Crown. The final scene in the restaurant where the two plaintiffs wind up paying for the defendant's lunch is reminiscent of one of Peder's earlier stories, in which the young farmhand tricks his antagonists (PJ 2.27).\n\n     Bremerholm in Copenhagen was a forced labor institution, originally a ship wharf, with the first prisoners sent there in the 1570s. According to Christian V's Danish law of 1683, the man from Bukballe would have been subject to Book 6 Chapter 4 Article 16 of the criminal code, which states, \"Overfalder nogen sin af Kongen forordnet \u00d8vrighed i deris Embede, straffis paa \u00c6re, eller Boeslod, efter Sagens Beskaffenhed\" (If anyone assaults any of the king's officials who are carrying out their duties, the punishment is either fine or imprisonment depending on the severity of the offense). The statute allows for a great degree of latitude. Punishment at Bremerholm, where one worked in irons, was generally considered \"the last possible punishment,\" and three years at Bremerholm would have been a considerable punishment. Interestingly, many of the statutes of Christian V's law were in effect up through the 1860s, and some still echo in contemporary Danish law. \n\n     Frederik VI (1768-1839) became king of Denmark in 1808. It was during his reign that Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden in 1814.", "danish_manuscript": "Om paa Grumstrup Mark, Vedslet Sogn\nligger Hede M\u00f8lle.

It was owned in its time by a district bailiff, who was in charge of Hads district. The river formed the boundary between the districts, and he had to build himself a house on the Hads side of the river to be in his jurisdiction, while the mill itself lay in another. He knew so much about the law that people often sought him out to solve disputes, particularly poor people. At that time, the royal post drove between Horsens and Aarhus, past Vedslet Kirke. There was this man up on Baastrup Mark, who lived at a farm called Bukballe, and he had to go to Aarhus. He goes out and wanted to come up and ride with this postal carrier. But the postal carrier was a moody fellow, and the two must have had a bit of an argument. So the other one has to walk behind but stays close to the wagon anyway so when the guy drives into the farm courtyard, and unhitches the horses, the man comes up, knocks one of the bridles out of his hands, and beats him silly in front of witnesses. It was a dangerous thing to do to lay a hand on the Royal Post, and he was naturally reported and had to go and defend himself in court. The least punishment he could get off with was to spend three years at Bremerholm, and he might even have to spend the rest of his life there. They asked all the wise legal minds both in Aarhus and in Horsens, but nobody dared help him.

He lured the ships ashore by lighting a fire up in the tower room when it was bad weather. The sailors mistook this for Skagen's light and, in that manner, many ships ran aground off of Hirtshals. In the daytime, Karl P\u00f8lse would go to the beach to see if there were any stranded people and, if there were, he took whatever valuables he found and killed the people. One time a ship stranded, and a man had come ashore from it with a chest. The man appeared to be a clergyman. When Karl noticed that the stranger was taking great care of the chest, he assumed that there was gold or the like inside it. He killed him and took the chest home in order to break it open. When he got it opened, there was only a copper chain link in it. But Karl P\u00f8lse believed that there was gold inside it and the smith had to file on it, but it didn\u2019t help at all, since it was copper and remained copper. Karl P\u00f8lse got so mad at this that he took the link and tossed it out into the pit. But for him, it was just like the chain link bound him, so he couldn\u2019t do anything. He sent for minister Mads from Horne, who also came out there and got Karl released from the chain link, but he had to build a chapel for the sin he\u2019d committed, and that\u2019s the current Asdal church. In addition, Mr. Mads found out that the chain link was the same one that St. Peter had been chained in. Mr. Mads forbade Karl P\u00f8lse from robbing at the beach anymore, maybe so that he could get more for himself. Karl continued anyways, but then the tower burned down one night, since the fire had been built too big in the tower room. When Mr. Mads heard that, he went out to Karl P\u00f8lse and told him that it was a punishment from heaven."}, {"story_id": 640, "full_name": "364 - 0.00 - DS_V_133", "publication_info": "DS_V_133", "annotation": null, "danish_manuscript": null, "english_manuscript": null, "danish_publication": "Da Povl V\u00e6ver var dreng, fulgtes ham og en lille pige ad ud til et hus p\u00e5 Dalby mark.

They had small children at one of the places where the girl worked, and they were being pulled in a wagon across the floor.

Then the old people thought: \u201cMy lord, we could get something out of this.\" They served the traveling gentlemen well, and showed them one of the other two mounds the next day, and not the right one. The strangers dug in the mound for many days, but didn\u2019t find a thing and went back to Copenhagen again. When they were good and gone, the old forest ranger dug in the right mound where the treasure was, and they found a bunch of gold and silver as well as a large, rusty knight\u2019s sword. They carried all of it home to their little house, and were delighted with their wealth. But when night came, there was such a rummaging about and commotion, that they couldn\u2019t stay in the cottage, and they had to stay up the whole night. The next day, there was nothing wrong, but as soon as it got dark, the same rummaging about began. It lasted like that for three nights, then the man went off and asked the advice of a cunning man. He told them that they should take the sword and carry it back up there and bury it, that would probably help.

He was so terribly hard on his peasants, that they could barely stand it. So there was a group of his people who agreed to kill him or, at the very least, beat him badly, and one day they surrounded him out in the field and two farmhands jumped on him. They didn\u2019t manage to kill him, but he did get his hands smashed badly. The perpetrators fled to Hamburg\u2014one of them later came back again. \n     The same Speitzer owned V\u00e5r and Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. He continued to be just as hard on his peasants, and one day he punished some people quite terribly. But a little later, the people at V\u00e5r saw one day that there was a stranger following along with Speitzer at the farm. The stranger looked kind of odd, but the people didn\u2019t pay him much mind, they doffed their hats and greeted him, as one did. Speitzer and this stranger now go and talk together, but no one could figure out what it was all about. The people only heard that Speitzer finally said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I \u2013 then he swore \u2013 thought.\u201d At the same time, he and the stranger were climbing a steep stone staircase, and made as if they were going to go into the castle. But just as they get to the top stair, they hear a scream and they see Speitzer fall backwards down the stairs, and then he was alone \u2013 the stranger had disappeared like a shooting star. Now Speitzer lay there and was dead, but if he was completely gone then I can\u2019t say for sure; I think so. After his death he continued to wander around the district, especially between V\u00e5r and Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. He wanted to cross the fjord, and the fishermen who were out there during the summer and fall and fished at night, both heard and saw him not once but many times. He looked like a big, black, ugly bird, and he shouted and yelled, and it was terrifying to hear, but the \u201cbeast\u201d was after him. One time there were a couple of young fishermen who talked badly about him one night; but then he was there immediately, and this devilry tumbled the boat so hard that the fishermen nearly went down and home. \n     There were, as we know, a  whole group of meadows down along the southern side of the fjord, from Aggersund and all the way to Nibe. Speitzer wanted his fingers in all those meadows, and he wrote to the king that, if he were allowed to have them, he would cover them with steel and let his lads dance over them. The King studies this letter a bit and he was about to let Speitzer have the meadows. But the king had a fool as was the custom in the old days; he was also to have a word about this, and he wasn\u2019t as crazy as the king. He said that the steel that the meadows were to be covered with were hay scythes, and the lads who were going to dance over them were Speitzer\u2019s villeinage peasants, and when the king got that explanation, he wouldn\u2019t let Speitzer have the meadows."}, {"story_id": 598, "full_name": "490 - 0.00 - DS_II_E_22", "publication_info": "DS_II_E_22", "annotation": null, "danish_manuscript": null, "english_manuscript": null, "danish_publication": "Lindkj\u00e6r er navnet p\u00e5 en stor t\u00f6rvemose, som tilh\u00f8rer stamhuset Ravnholt.

Da hun kom til porten og s\u00e5 skildvagterne, havde hun jo n\u00e6r mistet sit liv af skr\u00e6k, men da hun sagde, hvem hun skulde til, grinede de s\u00e5 sm\u00f6rret ad hende og lod hende passere. Nu gik hun da ind i borgg\u00e5rden, og der var jo s\u00e5 mange fine folk, s\u00e5 hun ikke vidste, hvem hun skulde vende sig til. Endelig kom der en pudsig lille fyr hen til hende og vilde se, hvad hun havde i sit forkl\u00e6de. \"Ej, ej\", sagde han leende, \"hvem skal have den kn\u00e6gt?\" \u2014 \"Det skal Hans med den lange n\u00e6se\". \u2014 \"N\u00e5, har han nu v\u00e6ret der igjen, ja, drengen ligner ham godt nok. F\u00f8lg nu med mig, min pige, s\u00e5 skal vi nok finde ham\". De fulgtes nu ad ind i en stor sal. Her spurgte den lille mand en skildvagt, om kongen var i sin stue. Nu begyndte pigen at blive hed om \u00f8rene, men inden hun vidste af det, stod hun i en pr\u00e6gtig stue ud for en mand, som hun straks t\u00e6nkte m\u00e5tte v\u00e6re kongen. \"Nu, Hans\", sagde hofnarren, som havde vist pigen vej, \"her kommer en af dine mange kj\u00e6rester, og hun har et helt forkl\u00e6de fuldt af drenge med lange n\u00e6ser\". Da pigen havde fattet sig lidt, s\u00e5 hun, at kongen var den samme vejfarende karl, som havde ligget natten over hos dem. Da nu kongen havde set rigtig b\u00e5de p\u00e5 pigen og drengen, var han villig til at tage sig skylden p\u00e5. Han for\u00e6rede hende da en bondeg\u00e5rd til arv og eje, som l\u00e5 i n\u00e6rheden af hendes hjem. Siden efter blev hun gift, og efter sigelsen ejes g\u00e5rden endnu af hendes efterkommere.", "english_publication": "It happened once that a farmhand who was traveling along a road came into a farm somewhere near Kolding. It was on toward nightfall, so he asked for lodgings and he got them. In the meantime, the farmer had a pretty daughter, whom the farmhand decided he wanted, and he made an agreement with her, so he got to sleep with her that night. Once the thing had happened, the girl began to complain, which she had a reason to, but the farmhand comforted her and said, \"Oh, don't take it so hard, sure I'm going to leave after breakfast, but if you get pregnant, you can always go up to Koldinghus fort and ask for Hans with the long nose, that's where I usually am.\" Well, the farmhand said goodbye and went on his way. Three quarters of a year later, the girl gave birth to a big boy, and the parents felt that it was sad that they didn't know anything about the father, but the daughter was cheerful and felt that she'd be able to find him. When she'd gotten better, and the boy had been baptized, she got up early one morning, took her boy in her apron, and went to Koldinghus fort. When she got to the gate and saw the guards, she almost died of fright, but when she told them who she wanted to see, they smiled buttery smiles and let her pass.  She went into the courtyard of the fort and there were so many fine people, that she didn't know who to turn to. Finally, a funny little fellow came up to her and wanted to see what she had in her apron. \"Ah, ah,\" he said, laughing, \"who is to have that lad?\" -- \"Hans with the long nose.\"-- \"Oh, has he been there again? The boy sure looks like him. Come with me my girl, we'll find him.\" She followed him into a large room. The little man asked a guard there if the king was in his room. Now the girl started to get hot around the ears, but before she knew it, she was in a magnificent room in front of a man she immediately figured was the king. \"Now Hans,\" said the court fool, who'd shown the girl the way, \"here comes one of your many lovers, and she has a whole apron full of boys with long noses.\" When the girl had composed herself a bit, she saw that the king was the same man who had slept at their place. When the king had gotten a good look at the girl and the boy, he was willing to take responsibility for them. He gave her a farm to own and to pass down that was right near her home. Later, she got married and according to what is said, the farm is still owned by her descendants."}, {"story_id": 663, "full_name": "492 - 0.00 - DS_II_A_32", "publication_info": "DS_II_A_32", "annotation": null, "danish_manuscript": null, "english_manuscript": null, "danish_publication": "Ellekongen skal opholde sig i de egne af landet, hvor landets konge endnu ikke har v\u00e6ret.

N\u00e5r barnet bliver fuldvoksent, kommer dets forbandelse, dyrenaturen frem; s\u00e5 snart m\u00f8rket er faldet p\u00e5, fj\u00e6rner den ulykkelige sig fra andre mennesker, hvorp\u00e5 dotten mellem skuldrene udvider sig, s\u00e5 hele legemet bliver l\u00e5ddent og med det samme f\u00e5r dyreskikkelse. S\u00e5 st\u00e5r der en varulv eller mare, eftersom det er en mand eller kvinde, der er forvandlet. Varulven farer ud for at se, om han kan tr\u00e6ffe en kvinde, der er frugtsommelig; kan han det og kan komme af sted med at rive fosteret levende ud af moderens liv og dr\u00e6be det, s\u00e5 er hans forbandelse h\u00e6vet med det samme, s\u00e5 han for fremtiden er som andre mennesker. N\u00e5r en varulv farer ud, humper den af sted p\u00e5 tre ben, medens det fjerde stikker bag ud som en hale. Hunde er al tid slemme ved en s\u00e5dan stakkel og farer hylende og halsende efter den, og da den kun kan humpe p\u00e5 tre ben, har hundene let ved at indhente den; den m\u00e5 da s\u00f8ge tilflugt mellem t\u00e6tte buske og tj\u00f6rne, hvor hundene ikke vover sig ind efter den.

Maren s\u00f8ger mest at komme ind, hvor m\u00e6nd sover, dog kan den ogs\u00e5 godt f\u00e5 i sinde at \"ride\" kvinder. Den kan kun komme igjennem n\u00f8glehullet eller et hul, som er boret i d\u00f6ren, loftet, vinduet eller andet tr\u00e6v\u00e6rk, derfor m\u00e5 man v\u00e6re s\u00e5 forsigtig at tilstoppe alle slige huller, hvis man vil undg\u00e5 mareridt.

Ridningen best\u00e5r i en meget sm\u00e6rtefuld trykken for brystet og helt op i halsen, det er ligefrem, som om man skal kv\u00e6les. Denne fornemmelse fremkommer ved, at maren l\u00e6gger sig oven p\u00e5 sengedynen lige over ens hj\u00e6rtekule, og skj\u00f6nt maren kun er lille, har den en um\u00e5delig v\u00e6gt, n\u00e5r den s\u00e5dan l\u00e6gger sig p\u00e5 \u00e9n. Den, som frygter mareridt, skal anbringe et rundt h\u00e5ndsold s\u00e5ledes, at han kan lade det falde over maren og fange den, men han skal anbringe snoren, eller hvad han nu bruger, s\u00e5ledes, at han, s\u00e5 s\u00e5re maren er ved at l\u00e6gge sig, kan lade soldet falde blot ved at gj\u00f8re en lille bev\u00e6gelse, ti har den f\u00f8rst lagt sig, s\u00e5 er det umuligt for ham at r\u00f8re s\u00e5 meget som en finger; det eneste, man under ridningen kan bev\u00e6ge, er \u00f6jnene. Lige med et, f\u00f6r man v\u00e9d af det, er maren borte, man m\u00e6rker ikke, den kommer ind, og heller ikke, at den forlader \u00e9ns sovekammer. Kan man p\u00e5 den n\u00e6vnte m\u00e5de slippe til at fange en mare, er den frelst fra forbandelsen, ti den har ikke magt til at kaste soldet til side, f\u00f6r den f\u00e5r talt alle hullerne i soldets bund; men det kan den ikke komme af sted med. N\u00e5r s\u00e5 dagskj\u00e6ret falder ind p\u00e5 den, er den forvandlet til menneske med det samme, og den bliver aldrig mare mere. Der er sikkert ikke f\u00e5 frugtsommelige kvinder, der tror p\u00e5 varulves tilv\u00e6relse, og af den grund ikke t\u00f6r vove sig uden for en d\u00f6r, n\u00e5r m\u00f8rket falder p\u00e5. ", "english_publication": "When a woman is pregnant for the first time and is afraid of the birthing pains, she can escape them whenever she wants. Before the day, she should go where there's a horse skeleton or a horse placenta and set it up. If she crawls through there three times in the name of the devil, she will never feel any labor pains; but there is a curse that attaches to her first born, the child will be half animal; if it is a boy, he will become a werewolf, but if it is a girl, she will become a mare. These poor little ones look like other children except that their eyebrows grow together over their nose. But they are also born with a hairy spot between their shoulders; and the mother tries to hide it quite conscientiously while the child is young, but when it gets bigger, then she tells it what the spot means and then the child has to be careful not to get undressed in front of others. When the child is fully grown, the curse of the animal comes out; as soon as it gets dark, the unlucky one goes away from other people, and the spot grows bigger until the whole body is covered with hair and it takes on the animal shape. Then there's a werewolf or a mare there, depending on whether it is a man or a woman who is cursed. The werewolf goes out to see if he can find a pregnant woman; if he can and if he can tear the fetus alive from the woman and kill it, then his curse is lifted and he is like other people from then on. When a werewolf goes out, it limps about on three legs, while the fourth sticks out back like a tail. Dogs are always mean to a poor person like that, and always chase him, barking and howling, and since it can only limp on three legs, the dogs have an easy time catching it; it has to try to escape through thick bushes and thorns, where the dogs don't dare go after it. You can always see on a werewolf person when the dogs have been after him, since he has all sorts of scratches on his face. A werewolf can also be released from his unfortunate circumstances if someone, while he is in his normal shape, says to him that he is a werewolf. One doesn't know that much about the shape of the mare, except that it is a little furry creature. The mare most often tries to get in where men are sleeping, but it can also decide to \"ride\" women. It can only come in through the keyhole or through a hole drilled in the door, the ceiling, the window or some other wood, and so one has to be careful to plug all holes like that if one wants to avoid being ridden by the mare (nightmares). One can also protect against the mare by placing one's clogs with the heels in, because the mare cannot come up into a bed unless it can step properly into the clogs first. The riding consists of a very painful pressure on the chest all the way up to the throat, it is just like one is going to be strangled. This feeling comes from the mare sitting on top of the blanket right over one's heart, and even though the mare is little, it is incredibly heavy when it lies on one like that. If one is afraid of the mare, one should get a round hand sieve (s\u00e5ld) and set it up so that it can fall down over the mare and catch it, but one needs to use a rope or whatever one wants to use, so that as soon as the mare lies down, that the sieve can fall just by making a small movement, since once it has lain down, then it is impossible to move even a finger; the only thing one can move during the riding is one's eyes. All of a sudden, before one realizes it, the mare is gone, one doesn't notice it come in, nor that it leaves one's bedroom. If one can get catch a mare in the manner mentioned, the mare is released from its curse, because it does not have the strength to throw the sieve aside until it has counted all the holes in the bottom of it; but it cannot do that. When the first rays of the day hit it, it turns into a person immediately, and then it will never be a mare again. It probably is not just a few pregnant women who believe in werewolves and, because of that, do not dare go outside when it gets dark."}, {"story_id": 539, "full_name": "238 - 0.00 - DS_IV_1690", "publication_info": "DS_IV_1690", "annotation": null, "danish_manuscript": null, "english_manuscript": null, "danish_publication": "I Midtsj\u00e6lland v\u00e9d gamle folk at fort\u00e6lle, at n\u00e5r folk d\u00f8de af den sorte d\u00f8d, nyste de uafladelig i de sidste \u00f8jeblikke.

An old legend tells that a dwarf king lived in the mound, and he was angry about this disturbance in his home and he swore that he would get revenge. It was the horses that came to suffer. The horses could go completely crazy in their stalls at night, and the veterinarian couldn't say what was wrong with them. At the time, there was an old theological student by the name of Hals minister who traveled about in Vendsyssel, and he'd make peace where things like that were going on. They also got hold of him at S\u00f8nderstrupg\u00e5rd. When he got there, more horses had died, and the others hung in their stalls since they couldn't stand. He said that it was the dwarf king who put his horses in the stalls, and that's why the other horses got sick, \"but now let's see about getting rid of them.\" A boy fifteen to sixteen years old was supposed to guard them one night. Twelve o'clock at night the boys hears something in the farm courtyard, and he wants to go see what it is, but then he hears three knocks on the barn door. \"Welcome,\" says the boy, and the door sprang open and something came into the barn, and the horses romped about and complained as if they were being tormented to death. The boy pulled himself together and, with great difficulty, managed to get out of the barn, and went and called Hals minister--he had been at the farm for quite a while--and he and the farm's people got up. When the minister got out into the barn, he said to the boy, \"You didn't keep quiet and mind your own business when you heard something even though I had told you to.\" Yes, he had. \"There's a lie in your throat,\" and the minister smacked him on the head so hard that the boy fell over. Then he regained consciousness, and the minister read something that no one understood. Then it started rustling about in the stalls, and when that stopped, the minister said, \"Can you see them riding?\" but no one could see anything. They could hear hoof beats that left the courtyard and went down the road. Since that time, there was nothing that rustled about, but all the horses died save for one. That one never lay down again when it was in its stall and had a hard time getting its snout to the ground when it was out grazing, it had to bend its knees like a little foal.

Der var ikke til mere end en, men nu fik de jo bytte det, som de var Venner til, og saa havde de ikke det mindste til om Morgenen.\n     Saa tager Mestertyven Ordet og siger, at det skulde hun ikke klage sig over, han skulde nok skaffe Br\u00f8d, for han var ikke Tyv for ingen Ting. Men nu var det bedst, de tog det med Ko til om Morgenen.\n     Da det saa gryede ad Dag, sp\u00f8rger han Konen, hvad de nu tr\u00e6ngte allermest til. \"Ja\", siger hun, \"det er ikke saa godt at sige, for vi har hverken det eller det.\"\n     \"Saa er det vel bedst, vi f\u00f8rst faar noget Br\u00f8d, og saa vil jeg nu kj\u00f8re til M\u00f8lle for jer.\"\n     \"Ja, det kan nok sagtens hj\u00e6lpe\", siger hun, \"vi har ikke Kornkj\u00e6rne i Huset.\"\n     \"Har I da ikke et Par S\u00e6kke og en Befordring?\"\n     Jo, de havde da begge Dele, og han faar et Par gamle Krikker sp\u00e6ndt for en Pjalt Vogn og kommer til Kj\u00f8ren med nogle tomme Poser bag i den. Da han saa kommer forbi en Sandgrav, holder han der og fylder alle S\u00e6kkene med Sand. Dem l\u00e6ssede han paa Vognen, og da han nu kj\u00f8rte videre, var der ingen, der skulde have sagt andet, end at det var et stivt L\u00e6s Korn, han havde at kj\u00f8re med. Nu kj\u00f8rte han til en M\u00f8lle, hvor de havde en sv\u00e6r S\u00f8gning, og da M\u00f8llersvenden netop havde travlt oppe i M\u00f8llen, da han kom, saa bar han selv Poserne ind den ene efter den anden og satte dem ved en hel Del andre S\u00e6kke. Nu gaar han op til M\u00f8llersvenden og siger, om han kan faa malet i Dag.\n     \"Nej\", svarer han, \"vi kan ikke i Dag, for vi har saa meget inde, og det skal males f\u00f8rst; men i Morgen maa du hente det, da skal det nok v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdigt.\"\n     Ja, det kunde han ikke bie efter, for de havde intet Br\u00f8d i den Gaard, hvor han tjente, og han skulde have det med sig tilbage; men saa fik han jo at tage et andet Sted hen.\n     \"Ja, det faar du jo\", svarer M\u00f8llersvenden, og saa gaar Tyven ned og b\u00e6rer S\u00e6kkene ud paa Vognen igjen; men han passede jo paa, at tage nogle andre S\u00e6kke med Mel i. Nu kj\u00f8rer han stiv Karl hjem med dem, og saa fik Konen travlt med at bage. Der blev saadan en Velsignelse af Br\u00f8d, at de havde nok for lange Tider.\n     Men nu var det ikke nok med det, for Konen lod sig forstaa med, at det var elendigt nu for dem ikke at have en Ko og saadan faa lidt Sm\u00f8r at brede paa Br\u00f8det. Saa siger Mestertyven, at det kunde der vel ogsaa blive Raad for. Om de havde ingen Sm\u00f8rfjerdinger? Jo, dem havde de endda nok af, havde der saa sandt v\u00e6ret noget i dem. \"Jaja, nu kj\u00f8rer jeg til Kj\u00f8bsted og faar Sm\u00f8r\", siger han. Men det kunde hun ikke forstaa, siden de aldrig havde en Skilling at give for det.\n     Han faar B\u00e6sterne for og kj\u00f8rer saa af Sted med nogle tomme Fjerdinger. Da han kommer til Sandbakken, fylder han dem med Sand og l\u00e6gger hvert Laag nok saa kj\u00f8nt paa. Derefter kj\u00f8rer han til Byen og ind ad en Kj\u00f8bmands Gaard, hvor han strax giver sig i F\u00e6rd med at b\u00e6re Fjerdingerne ind ad Pakhuset og s\u00e6tter dem der lige Side med en Del andre Sm\u00f8rfjerdinger. Saa gaar han ind i Butikken og siger, at han er her med et L\u00e6s Sm\u00f8r, om de vilde sige ham, hvad Pris de gav for det. Ja, de gav saa og saa meget. Nej, den Pris vilde han ikke s\u00e6lge Sm\u00f8r for, det var saa og saa godt, han kunde sagtens faa mere for det et andet Sted, og hvad han kunde nu rimle op. Ja, de gav ikke mere, sagde de, og saa rejste han af ud til Pakhuset og skulde nu have Sm\u00f8rret l\u00e6sset paa Vognen igjen, men passede naturligvis paa at faa nogle andre Fjerdinger, der var virkeligt Sm\u00f8r i, og saa kj\u00f8rte han lige hjem til den fattige Mand med det.\n     De maatte rigtig love for Tyven, nu havde de baade Tilmad og Br\u00f8d, og det var da saa meget dejligt.\n     Saa tr\u00e6ffer det i samme Godlag, at den rige Mands Bedstemoder d\u00f8de, og der bliver jo gjort Anstalter til at faa hende jordet. Folkene omme fra den fattige Mands hjalp dem noget til Rette med det, og derfor blev de da ogsaa budne med til Begravelsen tillige med den fremmede Karl, der var hos dem.\n     Saa om Eftermiddagen, da de havde spist, kommer de ud, det gj\u00f8r Gj\u00e6sterne, og skal til at se den rige Mands Kreaturer. Der havde de en fed Ko, som lige stod f\u00e6rdig til at slagte, og alle syntes de jo, at den var i saadan udm\u00e6rket Stand. Om Aftenen, da den fattige Mands Folk kommer hjem, siger Mestertyven, at det var bedst, de fik den Ko hentet, for den var v\u00e6rd baade at slagte og spise. Ja, det var nok ikke saa nemt at komme af Sted med. Jo, sagde han, det kunde let lade sig gj\u00f8re, og nu skulde de blot faa nogle Knive stenet, saa skulde han let hente Koen.\n     Han gaar nu op paa Kirkegaarden og graver den gamle Kone op, som var bleven jordet, og hende b\u00e6rer han ind i Kohuset og stiller hende an i den Baas, hvor Koen stod, og saa tr\u00e6kker han Koen ud; men Halen skar han af den og stak ind i Munden paa hende. Da han saa er kommen hjem med Koen, slagter de den jo den samme Nat. Nu havde de Br\u00f8d og Sm\u00f8r og Kj\u00f8d i Overflod.\n     Om Morgenen, da Pigen kom ud og skulde have malket, sidder Bedstemoder jo der i Baasen og har \u00e6dt Koen lige til Halen. Hun ind til Manden og fort\u00e6ller, at Bedstemoder gik igjen og sad ude i Kohuset.\n     \"Det er da forskr\u00e6kkeligt\", siger den rige Mand, da han ser det Syn, \"hun har altid v\u00e6ret havefuld, imens hun levede, vil hun til at \u00e6de hele H\u00f8veder, nu hun er d\u00f8d, saa er der jo ingen Raad til hende.\"\n     De vidste da aldrig, hvordan de skulde b\u00e6re dem ad, og de maatte da ned til Pr\u00e6sten og fort\u00e6lle ham, at Bedstemoder var kommen tilbage og havde \u00e6dt den r\u00f8de Ko for at stille hendes Sult, da hun ikke havde \u00e6dt nu i saa mange Dage, om han kunde ikke hj\u00e6lpe dem at faa hende sat v\u00e6k, for hun gik begribeligvis igjen?\n     \"Der er ikke andre Raad,\" sagde Pr\u00e6sten, \"end at vi maa have hende jordet igjen.\"\n     \"Kunde Pr\u00e6sten ellers ikke gj\u00f8re noget ved det, saadan som at mane hende?\" sagde Manden, \"for jeg er r\u00e6d for, hun ellers skal komme igjen. Jeg vil betale ham godt for det.\"\n     \"Jo, jeg skal nok gj\u00f8re min Flid, m\u00f8d kun nu med hende ved Kirkestetten, saa skal jeg indfinde mig og nok s\u00e6tte hende v\u00e6k for bestandig.\"\n     Saa bliver hun jo begravet for anden Gang, og Pr\u00e6sten fik hundrede Daler for hans Ulejlighed.\n     Men Tyven gik om Natten efter hen og skrabte hende op igjen, og saa satte han hende ind i den rige Mands Spisekammer, hvor der var mange T\u00f8nder og Ankere baade med \u00d8l og Mj\u00f8d og Vin. Det tog han alt sammen og bar ned til den fattige Mands, men de tomme T\u00f8nder bar han derop igjen, og saa satte han Bedstemoder der inde ved en af T\u00f8nderne med en T\u00f8ndehane i Munden.\n     Da Folkene nu kommer op om Morgenen, og Pigen lukker Spisekammerd\u00f8ren op, saa ser hun jo den gamle sidde der inde, og hun farer ind og raaber: \"Husbond! nu er Bedstemoder kommen igjen og sidder i Spisekammeret.\" Han kommer ned og skal have den Ting unders\u00f8gt. Da viser det sig, at hun har drukket alt deres \u00d8l og Mj\u00f8d og Vin og sad endnu og sugede paa T\u00f8ndetappen.\n     Saa maa han op til Pr\u00e6sten igjen og fort\u00e6lle ham, hvor elendigt det endnu var, og i Nat havde hun haft en forskr\u00e6kkelig T\u00f8rst, og saadan og saadan var det da.\n     Ja, siger Pr\u00e6sten, det var nok noget, han ikke kunde have med at gj\u00f8re.\n     Jo, han maatte da endelig s\u00e6tte hende v\u00e6k endnu en Gang, saa skulde han faa to hundrede Daler.\nJa, saa fik de jo at m\u00f8de ved Kirkestetten, han skulde da nok indfinde sig. Og det gik da saadan, at hun den Dag blev jordet for tredje Gang.\n     Nu havde de fuldt op af \u00c6delse og Drikkelse omme hos den fattige Mands. Men Mestertyven gaar alligevel op paa Kirkegaarden om Natten og kradser hende op igjen. Dern\u00e6st b\u00e6rer han hende ned i den rige Mands Storstue, hvor der stod et stort Skab, som var fuldt af Kl\u00e6der, og det var noget, der baade kunde varme og holde. Skabet ryddede han jo, og Sagerne tog han med sig, men Bedstemoder lod han blive i Skabet.\n     Da et af Kvindfolkene om Morgenen kom og vilde aabne Skabet for at faa noget T\u00f8j, falder den d\u00f8de ud og havde n\u00e6r revet hende om Kuld. Hun kommer hujende og br\u00f8lende ned til de andre og siger, at Bedstemoder sad inde i Kl\u00e6deskabet. Ganske rigtig, nu var hun der igjen, og hver Kl\u00e6destraad var henne, der havde v\u00e6ret i Skabet; jo, det var i god Orden, hun maatte jo have frosset sv\u00e6rt i de sidste Dage og havde nu faaet Sagerne sl\u00e6bt bort, men var selv bleven lukket inde til sidst.\n     Den rige Mand op til Pr\u00e6sten igjen og fort\u00e6ller ham Sagens Lejlighed. Nu vilde han give ham tre hundrede Daler for at s\u00e6tte hende v\u00e6k.\n     Nej, han kunde ikke have med det at gj\u00f8re, for han havde gjort sig al mulig Flid, og han kunde slet ikke forstaa, hvi hun saadan blev ved med at komme igjen. Men Manden lister jo ved ham, han skulde endeligen hj\u00e6lpe ham til Rette med det, og saa faar han ham til sidst overtalt. Altsaa bliver hun begravet for fjerde Gang.\n     Men det bliver det samme som f\u00f8r. Tyven gaar hen og skraber Liget op om Natten, og saa b\u00e6rer han hende ned ad deres Stald, hvor der stod to gode B\u00e6ster, det ene noget yngre end det andet. Der s\u00e6tter han Bedstemoder op paa det unge, saadan at hun rider bagl\u00e6nds, og binder hende godt fast, samt l\u00f8sner Hestens Grimeskaft. Om Morgenen, de kom op, og Karlen vilde ud at give B\u00e6sterne, saa ser han strax, da han lukker Staldd\u00f8ren op, at hun nu er kommen igjen og sidder skr\u00e6vs over Plagen. Han faar da D\u00f8ren lukket i en Fart og farer ind og klager sig elendig over det Syn, han der har set. Nu skulde Manden da ned til Pr\u00e6sten igjen for at faa hende sat v\u00e6k paany. Han s\u00e6tter det ogsaa i V\u00e6rk, i det han tr\u00e6kker den gamle Hest ud og s\u00e6tter sig op at ride paa den. Men nu var Staldd\u00f8ren saadan i to D\u00f8re, og da de om Dagen kun lukte Nederd\u00f8ren, saa rev Plagen sig l\u00f8s og springer ud gjennem D\u00f8raabningen. Men Bedstemoder tarsk Hovedet ret saa haardt imod D\u00f8rkarmen, da den sprang ud, og ved det Skrald kommer Manden til at se sig tilbage og opdager nu, hvad der er bag efter. Han blev saa r\u00e6d, at han jager af Sted det bedste han kan. Men han red aldrig saa st\u00e6rk, at hun enten var paa lige Side med ham eller ogsaa for af, og naar hun kom et St\u00f8d forved ham, saa syntes han, hun sad og saa efter, om han kom. Nok er det, han kommer ridende ind i Pr\u00e6stegaarden som en gal Mand, og Bedstemoder kommer flyvende bag efter. Pr\u00e6sten h\u00f8rer den Tummel og ser ud; da kan han kjende den gamle Kj\u00e6lling, han nu havde begravet fire Gange, og han farer ud og raaber: \"V\u00e6k med hende, hende har jeg haft nok med at gj\u00f8re!\" Manden b\u00f8nfalder ham jo om at s\u00e6tte hende v\u00e6k nok en Gang, men han siger, at han hverken vilde eller kunde have med hende at skaffe, og det kunde v\u00e6re det samme, enten han vilde give lidt eller meget for det.\n     Saa farer det jo af Sted, som det kunde, hjem igjen, og Manden var helt sagtmodig; hans Bedstemoder holdt godt nok Trop, og da han s\u00e6tter Hesten ind i Stalden, rider hun ogsaa ind. Da Manden er kommen ind i Stuen, klager han sin store N\u00f8d for Konen, nu vidste han ikke, hvad der var at gj\u00f8re, og han var bange for, at de blev hende aldrig kvit. Saa siger hun, at hun vilde endda gaa om til deres Nabos og sp\u00f8rge dem, om de havde ikke h\u00f8rt tale om saadant noget f\u00f8r, for det kunde i saa Fald godt v\u00e6re, at de kunde vide dem et Raad til at blive skilt ved den Gjenganger.\n     \"Ja, gaa endelig derom\", siger Manden, og hun rejser jo af.\n     Da hun kommer der, fort\u00e6ller hun, hvordan det stod sig hjemme, den gamle Bedstemoder, som de var med til Begravelse over, hun var den haardeste Gjenganger, de havde h\u00f8rt om fjern og n\u00e6r, for nu havde de haft Pr\u00e6sten til at kaste Muld paa hende fire Gange og betalt ham godt for det, og nu havde de budt ham fire hundrede Daler for at gj\u00f8re det femte Gang, men han hverken turde eller vilde indlade sig paa det tiere.\n     Saa siger den fattige Mand, at han havde en Karl, der rimeligvis kunde begrave hende saadan, at hun skulde ikke komme igjen. Ja, da vilde hendes Mand betale ham godt for det, det vidste hun.\n     Naa, Tyven bliver kaldt ind, og saa sp\u00f8rger Konen ham jo, om han vilde tage sig paa at begrave deres gamle Bestemoder saadan, at hun aldrig mere skulde komme igjen. Han siger, at det kunde han sagtens, det var en smal Sag for ham. Han havde en stor Bog, som han kastede op i, og saa sagde han, at der var kun \u00e9t Raad til at blive fri for det Gjengangeri, og det var, at den rige Mand skulde dele hans Gaard og Gods og lade den fattige Mand faa det halve af det, og saa forlods give ham selv femten hundrede Daler i Penge for hans Ulejlighed, ringere vilde han ikke gj\u00f8re det. Ja, det vilde de ogsaa gaa ind paa, for de maatte af med Bedstemoder, ihvad det skulde koste. Rigtig nok vidste hun, at hendes Mand havde ikke de femten hundrede Daler, men hun var sikker paa, at han kunde laane dem. Ja, saa skulde han ogsaa nok indestaa for, at hun aldrig skulde komme igjen. Dermed fulgtes de ad hjem, og han tog Bedstemoder ned af Plagen og rejste af med hende op paa Kirkegaarden, hvor han puttede hende ned for femte Gang. Manden var saa ude om de femten hundrede Daler, og da Karlen fik dem, gik han hjem til den fattige Mand og gav ham de halve, men selv beholdt han de andre, og saa tog han Afsked med dem der i Gaarden og rejste hans Vej, for nu var de blevne hjulpne godt begge to. Den rige Mand var det saadan gaaet tilbage med, baade fordi han maatte af med de mange Penge, og fordi han maatte dele hans Gaard, at han var gaaet i Armod, men den fattige var bleven godt ved det, og saadan skiftedes det da om for dem ved den Mestertyv.", "english_publication": "A farmhand for a cow\n\tOnce there were two men, the one was rich and had a large farm and enough of everything, but the other one lived in utter poverty, and there was not even a chance that the rich one would give the poor one even salt for an egg. Now I am going to tell you a little about how the two wound up changing places.\n\tThings had gone so bad for the poor one that he had nothing but a single cow left, and it looked like he was going to have to sell it to get some food. So one day he drags it off to market, but when he gets to an intersection, a wagon all of a sudden comes driving up in the other direction, and there were three farmhands sitting in it. They asked him where he was going, and he wanted to know where they were going. Well, they were going to hang the person sitting in between them, because he was a master thief.\n\t\"I think it is quite a sin to hang him,\" says the poor man, \"because he is a strong, healthy person.\"\n\tWell, that didn\u2019t matter, he was to be hung. \"But maybe you want to trade, and get a farmhand in exchange for a cow, and then we won\u2019t have to hang him, and you\u2019ll get your way.\"\n\tWell, that\u2019s all the same to me, he says, and then he decides to make that deal with them, and they decide to say when they get back that the thief had escaped from them. \n\tAnd so he gets the farmhand, and drags him off to the market, but the whole day passed, and no one came and asked what the thief cost. And so he had to take him home that evening.\n\t\"So, what did you get for the cow?\" said his wife when he got home.\n\tWell, he had gotten this here farmhand for it.\n\t\"Oh, are you crazy, and that\u2019s why things are the way they are here, don\u2019t you think we have enough people to feed, and now you come with another?\"\n\tWell, the man couldn\u2019t say anything to that, and then they were going to have some dinner; but the wife had nothing other than a little clump of porridge and a bread crust. There wasn\u2019t enough food for more than one, but now they had traded the thing they were friends with, and then there wasn\u2019t anything at all for the next day.\n\tThen the master thief says that she shouldn\u2019t complain, he\u2019d certainly get them some bread, because he wasn\u2019t a thief for nothing. But now it was best that they calmed down until the next day.\n\tWhen the dawn was breaking, he asks the wife what they needed the most. \"Well,\" she says, \"I don\u2019t really know since we have neither this nor that.\"\n\t\"Well, then it\u2019s probably best if we get some bread, and I\u2019ll drive to the mill for you now.\"\n\t\"Well, that certainly won\u2019t help,\" she says, \"since we don\u2019t have any grain in the house.\"\n\t\"Don\u2019t you have a couple of sacks and a conveyance of some sort?\"\n\tSure, they had both, and he gets a pair of old nags harnessed to a tattered wagon and they set off with a couple of empty sacks in the back. When he passes a sand pit, he stops and fills all the sacks with sand. He loaded them up on the wagon, and when he drove off, no one would have said anything other than it was quite a load of grain he had there. Now he drove to the mill, where it was quite busy, and since the journeyman miller was busy up in the mill, when he got there, he carried the sacks in himself one after another and put them down next to a bunch of other sacks. Then he goes up to the journeyman and asks if he could get his grain milled today.\n\t\"No,\" he answers, \"not today, we\u2019ve got so much that has to be milled first; but you can come and get it tomorrow, it\u2019ll certainly be finished by then.\"\n\tWell, he couldn\u2019t wait for that, they didn\u2019t have any bread at the farm where he worked, and he had to come back with it; then he\u2019d have to go someplace else.\n\t\"Well, you\u2019ll just have to do that,\" says the journeyman, and the thief goes down and carries the sacks back out to the wagon again; but he made sure that he took some other sacks that had flour in them. Now he drives quickly home with them, and the wife now got busy baking. They were blessed with more bread than they had had in a long while.\n\tBut that wasn\u2019t enough, because the wife let it be known that things were pretty bad since now, without a cow, they couldn\u2019t have even a little butter to spread on the bread. The master thief says that they could get enough to afford a cow as well. Did they have any butter forms? Yes, they had plenty of those, if only there had been something in them. \"OK, OK, I\u2019ll drive to the market town and get some butter to put in them,\" he says. But she didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d do that since they didn\u2019t have a shilling to pay for it.\n\tHe gets the horses harnessed up and drives off with some of the empty forms. When he gets to the sand pit, he fills them with sand, and puts each cover on nicely. Then he drives to the town and into a grocer\u2019s farm, where he immediately begins carrying the forms into the warehouse and puts them down next to the other butter forms. Then he goes into the store and says that he has come with a load of butter, and he wanted to know what they would pay for it. Well, they paid so and so much. No, he wouldn\u2019t sell butter for that price, it was so and so good, the butter, that he could certainly get more for it at some other place, and whatever, he just made something up. Well, they wouldn\u2019t pay any more, they said, and so he went out to the warehouse and was going to load the butter back into the wagon, but made sure, of course, that he took some other forms, which really had butter in them, and then he drove straight home to the poor man with it.\n\tThey really praised the thief, now they had both bread and butter, and it was really wonderful.\n\tThen it happens that the rich man\u2019s grandmother dies that same day and they make all sorts of arrangements to get her buried. The people from the poor man\u2019s house helped out with that, and so they were invited to the funeral along with the new farmhand who lived with them.\n\tThen that afternoon, after they had eaten, the guests come out and are going to look at the rich man\u2019s cows. They had a big fat cow that was ready to be slaughtered, and everyone thought that it was in really remarkable shape. That evening, when the poor farmer and his people got home, the master thief says that it would be best if they went and got that cow, because it was ready to be both slaughtered and eaten. Well, it wouldn\u2019t be that easy to make off with it. Well, he said, it could certainly be done, they just had to sharpen some knives, and then he\u2019d easily get the cow. \n\tHe goes up to the cemetery and digs up the old lady who\u2019d been buried and he carries her down into the cow barn and puts her in the stall where the cow had been, and then he leads the cow out; but he cut the cow\u2019s tail off and stuck it in her mouth. When he had gotten home with the cow, they slaughter it that same night. Now they had bread, butter and meat in abundance.\n\tThe next morning, when the hired girl went out to milk, Grandma is sitting there in the stall and has eaten the whole cow down to the tail. She runs in to the farmer and tells him that Grandma is walking again and is sitting out in the cow barn.\n\t\"That\u2019s horrible,\" says the rich man when he saw that sight, \"she was always gluttonous when she was alive, but if she now wants to eat entire head of cattle now that she\u2019s dead, there\u2019s not much that can be done.\"\n\tThey had no idea what to do, and so they went down to the minister and told him that Grandma had come back and had eaten the red cow to still her hunger, since she hadn't eaten now in so many days, could he help them to get rid of her, since she probably would go again?\n\t\"There\u2019s nothing else to do,\" said the minister, \"then to bury her again.\"\n\t\"Couldn\u2019t the minister do something like conjuring her?\" said the farmer, \"Because I\u2019m scared that she\u2019ll come back. I\u2019ll pay you very well for doing it.\"\n\t\"Well, I\u2019ll do my best, bring her to the church gate, I\u2019ll meet up with you and get rid of her forever.\"\n\tThen she is buried a second time and the minister gets one hundred daler for his trouble. \n\tBut the thief went after her that night and scraped her up again, and then put her in the rich man\u2019s dining room, where there were lots of barrels and containers of beer and mead and wine. He took all of this and brought it down to the poor man\u2019s house, but he carried the empty barrels back up there, and then he put Grandma in there besides one of the barrels with a barrel tap in her mouth.\n\tWhen the people woke up the next morning, and the hired girl opens the door to the dining room, then she sees the old one sitting in there and she runs in and shouts: \"Master! Now Grandma has come back again and she\u2019s sitting in the dining room.\" He comes down to investigate. It turns out that she has drunk all of their beer and mead and wine and was sitting there still sucking on a barrel tap.\n\tNow he had to go back to the minister again and tell him how bad things had gotten and that last night she\u2019d been horribly thirsty and so and so and that\u2019s how it was.\n\tWell, says the minister, he couldn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\n\tNo, he really had to put her away one more time, then he\u2019d get two hundred daler.\n\tWell, then they could meet up again at the church gate, he\u2019d certainly be there. And so it went, and she was buried for a third time that day.\n\tNow they had filled up on food and drink down at the poor man\u2019s house. But the master thief goes up to the cemetery anyway and digs her up again. Then he brings her down to the rich man\u2019s living room, where they had a big closet which was filled with clothes, and these were clothes that were warm and durable. He took everything out of the closet, and he took the things with him, but he left Grandma behind in the closet.\n\tThe next morning when one of the women went to open the closet to get some clothes, the dead one falls out and nearly knocks her over. She comes crying and screaming down to the others and says that Grandma is in the clothes closet. Sure enough, she was there again, and every stitch of clothes that had been in the closet was gone; well, that made sense, she'd probably been freezing these last few days and had now lugged the things off, but had finally wound up getting locked. \n\tThe rich man goes up to the minister again and tells him how things stand. Now he\u2019ll give him three hundred daler for getting rid of her.\n\tNo, he couldn\u2019t have anything to do with that, because he\u2019d done his best, and he couldn\u2019t understand how she could keep coming back. But the man begs him, he really has to help him, and he finally convinces him. And so she\u2019s buried for a fourth time.\n\tBut it's just like before. The thief goes and scrapes up the corpse at night, and then he carries her down to their stall where their two good horses stood, the one a bit younger than the other. He puts Grandma up on the younger one so that she\u2019s riding backwards, and ties her on tightly, and he loosens the horse\u2019s harness shaft. The next morning, when they wake up, and the farmhand goes out to feed the horses, as soon as he opens the barn door, he immediately sees that she\u2019s come back and is straddling the horse. He closes the door quickly and runs in and complains loudly about the sight he\u2019s seen there. Now the man goes down to the minister again to get her chased off once more. He starts off by taking the older horse out and getting up on it to ride. But the stall door was split and, since they only closed the bottom part during the day, the horse pulls itself free and jumps out through the opening. But Grandma slammed her head really hard against the head of the door frame when the horse jumped out, and when he hears the bang the man looks back and discovers what\u2019s behind him. He gets so scared that he rides off as fast as he can. But no matter how hard he rode she was either right next to him or a little ahead of him, and when she got a little in front of him it looked to him like she was sitting looking back to see if he was coming. He comes riding into the minister\u2019s farm like a mad man and Grandma comes flying in behind him. The minister hears the tumult and looks out; he recognizes the old hag that he now has buried four times and he runs out and shouts, \u201cAway with her, I\u2019ve had enough to do with her!\u201d The man begs him to get rid of her one last time, but he says he neither will nor can have anything to do with her, and it didn\u2019t matter if he\u2019d give him a lot or a little to do it.\n\tSo they leave as best they can and head for home, and the man was completely resigned to this; his grandmother kept up and when he rode into the stall, she did too. When the man comes into the living room, he complains to his wife, now he didn\u2019t know what to do, and he was afraid that they\u2019d never get rid of her. Then she says that she is going to go down to their neighbors and ask them if they\u2019d ever heard of such a thing before, because it could be that they might know how to get rid of a revenant.\n\t\"Yes, certainly go down there,\" says the husband, and she goes off.\n\tWhen she gets there, she tells them how things were at home, the old grandmother whose funeral they had attended, she was the worst revenant they had heard of near and far, because they\u2019d now had the minister throw dirt on her four times and paid him well for it, and now they\u2019d offered him four hundred daler to do it a fifth time, but he neither dared nor wanted to do that any more.\n\tThen the poor man says that he had a farmhand who probably could bury her so that she wouldn\u2019t come back. Well, her husband would pay him well for that, she knew that much. \n\tWell, the thief is called in and the wife asks him whether he\u2019d take it on himself to bury their old grandmother so that she\u2019d never come again. He says the he could certainly do that, that was a little thing for him. He had a big book that he opened up and then he said that there was only one way to get rid of this revenant and that was that the rich man was to split his farm and estate and let the poor man have half of it, and in addition give him fifteen hundred daler for his trouble, he wouldn\u2019t do it for less. Yes, they\u2019d go along with that, because they had to get rid of Grandma no matter what it cost. She was pretty sure that her husband didn\u2019t have the fifteen hundred daler, but he could borrow them. Well, then he\u2019d make sure that she\u2019d never come again. Then they went home together, and he took Grandma down off the horse and went off with her up to the cemetery, where he put her down for the fifth time. The man had gone out to get the fifteen hundred daler, and when the farmhand got them, he went home to the poor man and gave him half, but he kept the rest, and then he took his leave from the farm and went his way, because now those two had been helped quite a bit. The rich man had become poorer, both because of the money he had had to pay and because he had had to split his farm, and he had become destitute, but the poor ones had made out well and that\u2019s how they\u2019d switched places because of the master thief."}, {"story_id": 623, "full_name": "532 - 0.00 - DS_I_869", "publication_info": "DS_I_869", "annotation": null, "danish_manuscript": null, "english_manuscript": null, "danish_publication": "Der var nogle folk, der boede i Gudhjem lige op under en klippe, og de havde en datter, der sang s\u00e5 dejligt.
