Although there is no biographical information about Klemmen in Birgitte R\u00f8rbye's overview of folk healers, his practice is similar to that of many of his cohort described there (1976). \n\n     The theme of distrust and dishonesty among neighbors and friends informs the first of these stories and echoes themes found in many of Margrete's other stories. Rather than supporting an  ideal image of community where one can rely on neighbors for help, these stories paint a darker picture of a society where many people, even close friends, take whatever they can get.     \n\n     Ministers and folk healers were often at odds with each other, as the folk healers represented a clear secular challenge to the authority of the church. Klemmen's ability to fix his tormentor in the mud up to his ankles resonates with stories of ministers who conjure farmhands into the ground (AMJ 1.06).\n\n     The final story about the cursed cows highlights an important difference between witches and cunning folk. Whereas witches disrupt local economies for personal gain or vengeance (such as when they bewitch cows), cunning folk use magic to restore economic balance (such as finding the stolen canvas and the missing dog) and counteract disruptive forces.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand der hed Klemmen i\nSorte Mose han gik de altid til, naar de\nvilde have vist igien (i Hjortsh\u00f8j Sogn)\nS. kom der en Kone til ham og vilde\nhave ham til at vise sig en Al.

I worked there, that's why I know that. \"Well, if the dog's alive I'll get him for you, you can meet him tomorrow morning by the door, he'll be standing there and really happy to see you.\" It happened too. The next morning, the dog met him at the door. One time Klemmen was on his way to L\u00f8gten, and they decided to make fun of him. But he chased one of the men out so he stood in mud up over his ankles until he [Klemmen] came back and so that guy didn't make it to L\u00f8gten. When Klemmen got back he set him free. \"Yeah, you've made fun of Klemmen for a long time, but I don't think you'll do it anymore, otherwise you could wind up standing like that again.\" Klemmen did so much magic like that and if people had cows that were bewitched [they'd go to him].
