The man gets his comeuppance when he is forced to suffer his wife's labor pains. This story would have no doubt been quite attractive to women. \n\n     Midwives were more than specialized folk healers, although many midwives did in fact also practice as folk healers. They were part of a newly emerging class of civil servants and integral members of the emerging health care system (Norrie 1935; Petersen and Blomqvist 1996). The first midwife commission was established in Denmark in 1714. By 1791, all the districts in the country had a civil doctor (embedsl\u00e6ge) who could serve in the capacity of midwife, although that position was usually filled by a local, female midwife. In 1787, a national midwifery college opened in Copenhagen and, by 1810, a regulation was in place that required that all districts have a certified midwife. By 1851, every pastorate also had to establish a public health commission (sundhedskommission). All of these developments were part of an ever increasing process to improve people's health and reduce infant mortality.\n\n     Jens Peter's marriage was very short and produced no children. His wife may have died soon after they were married and, if that was the case, it is quite possible that she died in childbirth (much like Tang Kristensen's first wife); this might help explain why Jens Peter remembers this story. Jens Peter did have a child out of wedlock, and so he was no stranger to childbirth and the dangers that came with it.", "danish_manuscript": "En Jordmoder i Torslev Sogn h. var ved\nen Kone og Konen h. kunde klager sig\nF\u00f8dselsveerne var jo st\u00e6rke.
