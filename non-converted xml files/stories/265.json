The Swede is an outsider and therefore may be linked to the supernatural although in most of these stories, the magical outsider is a Finn. The Swede alludes, as Kirsten Marie does in many of her spells, to sympathetic magic with the frog's release by the snake likened to the birthing process. Other beliefs mention grass snakes using toads to hatch their eggs (DS II E 136), and yet other stories connect these snakes to the viper king (DS II E 144). Interfering with snakes is generally considered to be dangerous (DS II E 142).", "danish_manuscript": "A kom en Dag forbi en Snog der laa med en Fr\u00f8\ni Munden, saa Bagbene endnu sad frem.\ns. pirrede a til den og nu slap den Fr\u00f8en\nog snoede sig bort of Fr\u00f8ene hoppede.
