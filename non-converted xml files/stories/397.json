The two thieves start off as Danish Robin-Hoods but quickly degenerate in the narrative into thugs. The thieves encapsulate many of the worries that people had about the large number of poor who wandered the countryside, particularly at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries. These worries undoubtedly influenced the fairly rapid move in the 1860s toward the establishment of poor farms in many Jutlandic districts (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). \n\n      The hunt for the two thieves is helped along by the intervention of a miller. In this manner, Peder injects himself--or at least his representative--into the narrative. The song that is written about Kyvling-S\u00f8ren is also clearly of interest to Peder given his work as a fiddler. Peder is similarly fascinated by the escape tool that the thief hides in his bowels. \n\n     The stocks house (stokhus), named for the whipping stocks on its premises, where Kyvling-S\u00f8ren is incarcerated was one of Denmark's most notorious prisons. Originally a military prison, it was opened to civilian prisoners in 1741. The prisoners were broken into two groups: \"honest\" prisoners and \"dishonest\" prisoners, this latter group being those who had been whipped. Whipping was seen not only as a harsh punishment but also as a loss of honor. The prison was closed in 1860.\n\n     The narrative hovers between fascination with these outlaws, and the celebration of their harsh punishment.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var et Par Kj\u00e6ltringer der huserede en G.\noppe i Ry Skov, de havde deres Tilhold i\nSavkulerne Kyvling S\u00f8ren og s. en de kaldte\nJens Knop.

It was Kyvling-S\u00f8ren and one they called Jens Knop. They were in the habit of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. But they were rough, they chopped the breasts off of women and stabbed children to death with their knives. But then it got to be a bit too much, and the peasants got together and hunted them down at their own risk and cost. They shot Jens Knop but they couldn't find Kyvling-S\u00f8ren. They had chased him over Ry bridge, but then he jumped into the river and they hadn't seen him since. They didn't believe he'd drowned since he was a good swimmer, and so now they'd simply lost trace of him. So now they went along the riverside to make sure that he didn't slip up into the woods again. As they lay there along the edge of the lake and talked about him, one of the millers comes over to them. Now as they're lying there looking out over the lake, he says, \"That tuft of grass wasn't there last night.\" So one of the men grabs his rifle and shoots at the tuft and he hits him in the thick part of the arm. He had his hand up and was holding this tuft of grass up over his head. They got hold of him and he was sent to the stockade over in Copenhagen. He was supposed to start off by getting 27 lashes, him and one other guy. The other one was first, but he didn't handle it well at all. Then S\u00f8ren says, \"If you give in after so little, then you've got to be kind of soft.\" It was S\u00f8ren's turn next. He was tied to the stocks, so that his knees were bound to it first and then his hands were bound to them, then his back was stretched and he got whipped with nine separate whips that had been soaked in brine, and he got three lashes with each one. The last three whips the Master could run his fingers down and the blood came pissing out of them. But they didn't hear a word from him. Then he was there for twenty-seven years and then he got out and he was an old man. He couldn't do anything at that point, and he earned his keep by going around and singing and playing music for people. Among other things, he played a piece he called Kyvling-S\u00f8ren's piece, which is still played today occasionally. The last time that they caught him, they held him. But he'd been arrested a lot before and sat in jail but they never could keep him more than a night and that was because he had a contraption, shaped like a dagger, and it could be used as a saw on its one side, and a file on the other and he had it in a holster and he hid it in his anus.
