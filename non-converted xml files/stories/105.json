The best known scholarly treatment of this tale is Walter Anderson's Kaiser und Abt (1923, 182ff). In the folktale fair copy collection, one finds another variant of this tale from the immediate area placing Rold minister in the role of foolish minister (\u00c6v.1361b told by Kirsten Kristensdatter, Aarestrup). The closeness of the variants suggests that the Rold minister was a local tradition dominant for the foolish minister.\n\n     The \"Blue maiden\" was a much discussed torture device (Stevnsborg 1992). Feilberg offers the following description: \"There were three steps up to the maiden; when the sinner stepped on the first step, she smiled; on the second step, she opened her arms; on the third she closed her arms around him and strangled him or cut his head off\" (Feilberg 2, 43). It is closely related to the \"Iron Maiden,\" the best known example of which was destroyed during the air raids in Nuremberg during World War II.\n\n     The manuscript is somewhat confusing since BJK 3.43 is interpolated in the midst of the story. The manuscript is also remarkably spare, and Tang Kristensen fills out the narrative considerably in the published version.", "danish_manuscript": "(Pr\u00e6sten i Rold skrev over D\u00f8ren\nHan boede uden [Bsk] Sorg og Modgang.
