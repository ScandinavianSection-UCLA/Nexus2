Hun kj\u00f8rte om natten fra Vigerslev kirkeg\u00e5rd, hvor hun var begravet, og hjem til Langes\u00f8 med fire sorte heste, og gloende tunger h\u00e6ngte dem ud af halsen. Hun skulde igjennem Rue, men her boede en mand i spr\u00f8jtehuset, og han holdt ikke af den sp\u00f8gen og kj\u00f6rsel forbi sit hus ved nattetid. Han str\u00f8ede derfor h\u00f8rfr\u00f8 p\u00e5 vejen uden for sit hus, ti s\u00e5 kunde hun ikke kj\u00f8re der over. Hun kunde s\u00e5 heller ikke komme over, men s\u00e5 blev der s\u00e5dan en bryden og tumlen i huset, at der n\u00e6ppe var til at v\u00e6re, ti hun m\u00e5tte s\u00e5 der igjennem. S\u00e5 str\u00f8ede manden ikke h\u00f8rfr\u00f8 tiere, ti det var da v\u00e6rre, n\u00e5r hun skulde igjennem huset, end som n\u00e5r hun kj\u00f8rte forbi. Hun blev alts\u00e5 ved med sin natlige f\u00e6rd; men til sidst blev det dem for str\u00e6ngt p\u00e5 Langes\u00f8, ti hun holdt s\u00e5dant et styr der p\u00e5 g\u00e5rden om natten, s\u00e5 hun var n\u00e6r ved at s\u00e6tte alt p\u00e5 den anden ende. Men s\u00e5 var der pr\u00e6sten Balslev i H\u00e5rslev, han var s\u00e5 klog, at han kunde mane. De fik da ham til at mane fru Ida. Han manede hende i Sortemose ved Langes\u00f8. Han havde sine b\u00f8ger med, men da han tog den f\u00f8rste og vilde begynde at l\u00e6se, s\u00e5 slog hun den fra ham, lige s\u00e5 den n\u00e6ste, han tog, men den tredje m\u00e5tte hun lade ham beholde. Der blev s\u00e5 rammet en p\u00e6l igjennem hende, og den sidder i mosen endnu.

She drove at night from Vigerslev cemetery, where she was buried, home to Langes\u00f8 on a carriage pulled by four black horses with glowing tongues hanging out of their mouths. She had to go through Rue, but there was a man who lived there in the pump house who didn't like all this haunting and driving past his house at night. He spread linseed on the road in front of his house so she couldn't drive over it. She couldn't get past it either, and then there was a huge tumult in the house so that they almost couldn't stay there, because she had to go through the house instead. Then the man didn't spread any linseed anymore, since it was worse when she had to go through the house than when she drove past. She continued with her nightly journey; but finally it got to be too bad there at Langes\u00f8, since she made such a commotion at the farm there at night that she was about to turn everything upside down. But then there was a minister Balslev in H\u00e5rslev, he was so wise (cunning) that he could conjure. They got him to conjure Lady Ida. He conjured her in Sortemose near Langes\u00f8. He had his books with him, but when he took the first one and wanted to start reading, she knocked it away from him, and the same thing happened with the next one he took, but she had to let him keep the third one. A post was then rammed down through her, and it is still out in the swamp to this day. If someone happens to knock into the post or rock it, then one hears a voice from below that says, \"Rock hard.\" \n     They say that if there was a party and someone started talking about the workers and said that they were just as good people as them, then Lady Ida would say, \"Even if all the ecclesiastics allow the workers to go to Heaven, my son Jakob and I will not allow that.\"", "keywords": {"keyword": ["black", "books", "bracken", "burial", "cemetery", "conjuring", "Cunning Folk", "day", "death", "farm", "haunting", "heaven", "home", "horse", "house", "ida", "Jakob", "lady", "minister", "night", "party", "post", "road", "seeds", "son", "swamp", "tongue", "voice", "worker"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Herrem\u00e6nd, fruer, jomfruer", "heading_english": "Manor lords, ladies and misstresses"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
