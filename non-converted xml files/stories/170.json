Instead, she is a threatening creature, whose antics first bother the farmhand, and later lead to the destruction of his livelihood.\n\n      Burning the mermaid is not the best strategy for dealing with her and, like most supernatural beings, her reaction is extreme. The seeming nonsense she utters parallels other phrases uttered by supernatural beings, the best known of these being the announcement of the death of Pan (see Boberg 1934).\n\n     Tang Kristensen did not publish this version, choosing a later variant instead (JPP 4.02). The note at the end of the manuscript edition is not a reference to H.C. Andersen's mermaid, but rather a reference to another variant of this story told by Gerhard Peter Andersen from L\u00f8rslev and appended to Jens Peter's later variant.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var ude i Jerup i Elling Sogn da\nkunde de ikke faa Salt i den gl.
