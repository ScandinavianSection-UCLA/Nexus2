In this story, it is a manor lord, rather than a farmer, who is the victim. The poor swineherd who is taken hostage emerges as the most important figure in the story. The village people are understandably more concerned about saving one of their own than saving the manor lord's pigs. Amusingly, the robbers have sold most of the pork by the time they are captured. The rhyme that the swineherd sings is reminiscent of several other rhymes that appear in Jens Peter's stories.
