Da pr\u00e6sten opdagede dette forhold, tvang han kusken til at kj\u00f8re hende til Kj\u00f6benhavn. De kom da s\u00e5 afsted, blev sat over med f\u00e6rgen fra Koster og kom et godt stykke ind p\u00e5 Sj\u00e6lland. S\u00e5 blev pigen imidlertid syg og skulde f\u00f8de, og kusken vilde derfor kj\u00f8re ind i en g\u00e5rd ved vejen; men pigens broder, som ogs\u00e5 var med, tog linerne fra ham og kj\u00f8rte videre trods s\u00f8sterens ver\u00e5b, indtil hun d\u00f8de p\u00e5 vejen. Nu m\u00e5tte han da vende om og give sig p\u00e5 hjemvejen; men da han og kusken kom hjem, havde pigen allerede l\u00e6nge v\u00e6ret hjemme, og siden kunde man i lang tid se hende g\u00e5 omkring i pr\u00e6steg\u00e5rden, som mens hun levede, indtil hun endelig blev manet ned i kj\u00e6lderen, og der blev rammet en p\u00e6l igjennem hende. En for nylig afd\u00f8d gammel kone har fortalt mig, at i hendes ungdom havde hun tit set p\u00e6len, som stod nedrammet i kj\u00e6ldergulvet, og ingen turde r\u00f8re den, s\u00e5 den st\u00e5r der sandsynligvis endnu, hvis folk ikke er blevne mere dristige siden den tid.\n     Samme kone fortalte tit, at den gang hun tjente som stuepige i Borre pr\u00e6steg\u00e5rd, havde pr\u00e6sten her en kapellan ved navn Engelsted, som kunde meget mere end pr\u00e6sterne i vore dage, og den sorte bog havde han da ogs\u00e5. En s\u00f8ndag, medens kapellanen var i kirken for at forrette gudstjenesten, og hun kom ind i hans v\u00e6relse for at gj\u00f8re rent, gav hun sig til at kikke lidt i en bog, der l\u00e5 p\u00e5 bordet, og da hun f\u00f8rst havde begyndt, kunde hun ikke holde op igjen, men m\u00e5tte blive ved at l\u00e6se med stadig stigende iver og interesse. Hun havde imidlertid ikke l\u00e6st ret l\u00e6nge, f\u00f6rend kapellanen kom farende ind og rev bogen fra hende, idet han gav hende \u00e9n p\u00e5 \u00f8ret og sagde: \"Hvad vilde du have grebet til, hvis 'den gamle' var kommen!\" og derp\u00e5 satte han sig selv til at l\u00e6se i bogen, rimeligvis for at holde 'den gamle' borte. Men siden fik hun at vide, at kapellanen havde brudt af, sagt amen og var rendt ned af pr\u00e6dikestolen og hjem, inden han var halvt f\u00e6rdig med sin pr\u00e6diken, s\u00e5 han m\u00e5tte jo p\u00e5 en eller anden m\u00e5de kunne m\u00e6rke, at der var noget galt p\u00e5 f\u00e6rde der hjemme.", "english_publication": "A minister\u2019s daughter in Borre was secretly engaged with the driver and had gotten pregnant by him. When the minister discovered this relationship, he forced the driver to drive her to Copenhagen. They started off then, were brought over by the ferry from Koster and had gotten a good ways into Sj\u00e6lland. Then the girl gets sick and is going to give birth, and so the driver wants to drive into a farm along the road; but the girl\u2019s brother, who was also along, took the reins from him and continued driving despite his sister\u2019s labor screams, and she finally died on the road. Now he had to turn around and start on the road home; but when he and the driver got home, the girl had already been home for a long time, and after that one could see her walking around the parsonage just like when she was alive, until she was finally conjured down in the cellar, and they drove a post through her. An old woman who recently died told me that, in her youth, she had often seen the post, which was driven into the cellar floor and nobody dared to touch it, so it's likely still there unless people have become more daring since that time. \n     The same woman often told that when she was working as a hired girl at Borre parsonage, the minister had a chaplain with the name Engelsted who could do a lot more than the ministers today, and he also had the black book. One Sunday, while the chaplain was in the church saying the service, she went into his room to clean up and she looked a little bit in a book that was lying on the table. When she had first started reading she couldn\u2019t stop but had to continue, and did so with increasing interest and zeal. She had not read very long before the chaplain came running in and tore the book away from her and boxed her on the ear and said: \u201cWhat would you have done if \u2018the Old One\u2019 had come!\u201d at which point he began reading in the book, most likely to keep \u2018the Old One\u2019 away. But later she found out that the chaplain had stopped preaching, said \u201cAmen,\u201d gotten down off the pulpit and gone home before he was even half finished with his sermon, so he must have been able to feel somehow or other that there was something wrong at home.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["birth", "black book", "books", "brother", "cellar", "chaplain", "church", "conjuring", "daughter", "death", "discovery", "driver", "ear", "farm", "ferry", "floor", "girl", "home", "labor", "marriage", "minister", "name", "old", "parsonage", "post", "pregnant", "pulpit", "reins", "road", "sermon", "sickness", "sister", "sj\u00e6lland", "Sunday", "table", "today", "woman", "work", "youth"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Kvindelige gjenf\u00e6rd", "heading_english": "Female revenants"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
