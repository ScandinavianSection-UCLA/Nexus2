In this story, the guilty haunt returns as a dog and wreaks havoc on the farm (Pentik\u00e4inen 1969). The desire to \"take it with you\" when you die comes across clearly here. \n\n     Eight hundred daler was a significant sum of money and would have represented a considerable estate for the wife and, presumably, her children. In most stories of ghosts that haunt for hidden money, the amounts are much more humble (DS V 1002). Usually, it is the owner who has hidden the money (DS V 1007), and he or she haunts to reveal its location. It makes little sense that the wife agrees to hide the money in the casket for her husband. Taking the money out of the household and local economy could hardly have been a good thing, and might account in part for the clear prohibition against hiding money in caskets. When he discovers the hidden money, the wise minister, Master Nielsen, insists on removing it, returning it to the wife and, by extension, the local economy. The discovery of the money prior to the man's burial, and his subsequent haunting because of that, distinguishes this story from other stories about haunts who return as solicitous haunts to reveal the location of money (DS V 972; Pentik\u00e4inen 1969). The haunt in this story is hardly solicitous, appearing to reclaim his fortune rather than give it away. The dog's rampage through the farm is nearly as destructive as the man's attempt to take the money with him.\n\n     The question also arises as to how the man had acquired this small fortune--the implication, given his return in the form of a destructive, black dog (read Satan) is that the money represents ill-gotten gains. Consequently, the haunt is not an innocent, solicitous haunt, but rather a guilty haunt; accordingly, it is far more dangerous to the community. \n\n     The minister confronts the haunt and forcibly conjures him down at a boundary zone, in this case the mill dam. Such conjuring, outside the bounds of the consecrated grounds of the church, is generally reserved for the devil and guilty haunts (DS IV 691).", "danish_manuscript": "En Mand der boede paa Aastrup M\u00f8lle\ns\u00f8nden og vesten for Hj\u00f8rring, h.
