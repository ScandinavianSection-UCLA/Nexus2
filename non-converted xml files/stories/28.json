Numerous stories that attest to Queen Margaret I attacking robbers near Egholm Castle (DS IV 146). Robber dens are usually located in wooded or hilly areas, and the area south of Gammel Sk\u00f8rping provides such cover. The Queen is too clever for the robbers, and her army manages to destroy them. \n\n      Stubberup farm lies several hundred meters to the south of Ersted. South of that, and on the east side of Lindenborg River is a ruin marked as \"\"Subberuphus voldsted\"\" [walls of Stubberuphus]. Just to the west of Gammel Sk\u00f8rping is a mound 142 feet high, noted on maps as Margreteh\u00f8j. This mound is linked in other stories to Margaret's exploits with the robbers (DS IV 146). Sk\u00f8rping marsh stretches for several kilometers to the south. The distance from Sk\u00f8rping marsh to Stubberuphus voldsted is approximately six and a half kilometers.\n\n     Egholm Castle, which lies on a small island south east of Sk\u00f8rping, has a history dating back to the time of King Valdemar Sejr (1202-1241). The main building at Egholm was in fact blown to smithereens in 1765, not by the Queen but by its owner at the time, Frederik Chr. Rosenkrands, who later became prime minister. Early maps note the ruins at Egholm Castle to the north and west of Gammel Sk\u00f8rping. In other stories, Margaret's stone is located close to the castle walls of Egholm (DS IV 151).\n\n     In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen concatenates, and rearranges several of Jens's stories, presenting a series of tangentially related stories as a coherent whole. The published version is made up of stories BJK 1.25, BJK 1.27 and BJK 1.36.", "danish_manuscript": "Der har v\u00e6ret en R\u00f8verslot et bitte Korn s\u00f8nden\nfor Ald\u00e5l der nede ved Aaen.
