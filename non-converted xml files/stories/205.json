While some stories attest to the victim returning to human society (DS I 897), and others to the victim's desire to stay with the mound dwellers (DS I 898), it is uncommon for the kidnapped girl to reappear at the farm, discuss her fate with her father, and then disappear again. Here, the girl acts not so much as a kidnap victim but more in the manner of an innocent, solicitous haunt, asking her father to stop grieving over her absence. \n\n     The second story confirms the link between the mound dwellers and haunts, since bloody spades are a more common feature of stories about murder that will out than those about mound dwellers (DS IV 1391).\n\n     Children were confirmed twice a year, and the ceremony was one that people were likely to attend even if they otherwise did not attend church on a regular basis. This explains why the old father is home alone. It also provides the liminal timing that is a common feature of supernatural encounters.", "danish_manuscript": "Der er 2, 3 gaarde i Taars Sogn de\nkalder Koldbroen, der bliver en\nPige v\u00e6k fra en grd. hu var v\u00e6k i\nen 5. 6.
