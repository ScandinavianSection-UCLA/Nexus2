Common variants of this story include the motif of an ominous voice from the river indicating the impending peril (DS II D 48). Rivers and streams created clear boundaries in the landscape. They could be dangerous to cross because of poor roads, the need to travel even when it was dark, and flooding. The boundary nature of streams and rivers also made them dangerous, at least in narrative, as they represented a powerful limen. The water spirit here demands a sacrifice, and people can do little do stop it, a metaphor for the powerlessness that people can feel when confronted by the uncontrollable forces of nature.\n\n     Kirsten Marie stresses the cruel death the woman suffers as she is buoyed by her skirts before finally succumbing. In another telling of the story, she emphasizes the heartbreak her uncle suffers when he hears the story (KMP 2.11).\n\n     It was common that men and women, when visiting the large market towns such as Randers, would wear their best clothes, helping to explain why the woman was wearing such elaborate skirts. There is a bridge over the Alling river at Sjelbrosten along the road from Mols to Randers. Given Kirsten Marie's reference to the Alling river in her later telling of the story, this is the likely location of the story, rather than the town of Sjelle, which lies farther to the south, and would not be along the likeliest route from Mols to Randers.", "danish_manuscript": "Ved Sjelle Bro l\u00f8ber en Aa.
