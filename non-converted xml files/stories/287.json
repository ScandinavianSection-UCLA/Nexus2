The farmhand attempts to bring home the harvest, only to have the witch tip his wagon. Oddly, the witch seems to be deriving no clear personal benefit from this--rather, she is simply destabilizing the cart and, by extension, the local economy (BJK 1.35).\n\n     The farmhand's approach to dealing with the threat is straightforward and somewhat unusual. The threat of a beating brings the witch around. In other legends, a wide range of strategies are endorsed for dealing with witches, from calling cunning folk, the local minister, or the local magistrate, to dealing with them by oneself (Tangherlini 2000). \n\n     Witchcraft trials were no longer common in Denmark in the nineteenth century, and the accusation of witchcraft, although accompanied by local approbation, had little legal weight. It is worth noting that the woman who is described here as a witch is a poor, elderly woman. Accusations of witchcraft, when they were made, were frequently leveled at economically disenfranchised, single women. This status contrasts significantly with that of the cunning folk who, because of their community status, could sidestep such accusations (Tangherlini 2000).\n\n     The name Ma' R\u00f8gters is likely an abbreviation of the name of a person, Maren, who was married to or had been married to, a r\u00f8gter, or stable hand.", "danish_manuscript": "En gl.
