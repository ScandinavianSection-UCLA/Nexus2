It is unclear who has taken the pipe, although the uncle suspects theft, as do the farmhands. The sudden reappearance of the pipe suggests that it had been \"borrowed\" by the mound dwellers.\n\n      The story focuses primarily on the abilities of the cunning man, Klemmen, to help find the pipe. Ane Margrete also attests to the abilities of Klemmen to \"show again\" (AMJ 2.07). This ability was widely attested in legend, and was attributed to both cunning folk and wise ministers (AMJ 1.06 and 2.07; JPP 1.06; DS VI 1078).", "danish_manuscript": "Min farbroder havde en Pibe der var bleven henne\nde var ude at slaa Kl\u00f8ver, 2 karle, s om\nMiddagen, gik de hjem og da glemte h. hans\nPibe ude i Marken.
