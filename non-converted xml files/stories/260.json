This family became the most famous family of cunning folk in Denmark. There are numerous stories related to their practice in Danske sagn (DS VI 882, 886).\n\n    Up through the nineteenth century, there was considerable competition among cunning folk. Because of strict laws against quacksalvery and practicing medicine without a license, cunning folk often relied on word of mouth to support their practices. Despite the laws, authorities often \"looked the other way\" at these practices since the cunning folk represented, in many cases, the only access to health care for many people living in rural areas. Indeed, the Haaning family had a close working relationship with the pharmacy in L\u00f8gst\u00f8r (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 105). \n\n     Stories such as this attest to the considerable discussion among the rural population not only of whether the cunning folk could help but also about which cunning folk were worth visiting. In this story, and the following story, the cunning woman's cures are shown to be ineffective.", "danish_manuscript": "A havde en Farbroder der var n\u00e6sten blind.\nHan var hos Konen i Vindbl\u00e6s og hun gav ham\nnogle Urter (Owter) der skulde koges, og h.\n\n5220A\nskulde drikke. s gaa til en M\u00f8lle og faa noget\nKnagfedt og s. sm\u00f8rre et Plaster og l\u00e6gge i\nhans Nakke.

Amongst the herbs, there was a piece of paper with nine notches [picture], and he was supposed to take one notch each morning for nine mornings, starting from the narrow end.
