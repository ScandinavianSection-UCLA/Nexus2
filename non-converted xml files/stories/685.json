Most of the crew was dead, but some came ashore alive, among them a bishop from England, who held back from the people who lived there by the shore when they approached. He let it be known from a distance that the plague had raged aboard their ship and that he and the others who had made it ashore were sick and inevitably would die and so he warned them from coming any nearer. The people paid no attention to the warning and the result was that they were infected and then the plague spread even wider and also here in this country it resulted in great destruction. The legend tells lastly that the dead bishop was buried here in the cemetery. One can find another reminder of that sorrowful time there in the cemetery in a depression immediately to the south west of the church, which is still called the plague hole, where there are no traces of old graves even when their closest relatives have their graves at the cemetery.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["attention", "bishop", "black", "burial", "cemetery", "church", "country", "death", "england", "foreign", "grave", "legend", "old", "plague", "ship", "shore", "sickness", "sorrow", "south", "stranded", "west"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Pest og sygdomme", "heading_english": "Plague and illnesses"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
