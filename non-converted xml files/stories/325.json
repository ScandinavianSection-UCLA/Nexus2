Apparently, during performance, Margrete repeated what she had sung earlier (probably by mistake), and Tang Kristensen, rather than record the lines again, simply noted \"osv. Se foran\" [etc. See above]. He also added the lyre, as in the manuscript it is unclear what it was that was gilded (there is no referent for the adjective). In the published version, Tang Kristensen also interpolates the second line of verse two, likely from another variant by another informant as the phrase does not appear in Margrete's repertoire. The wording of the postscript is slightly different in the printed version where the reference to Gulenborg being banished from the land is absent. Tang Kristensen turned the reference to banishment in the postscript into the missing line of verse 2 in the printed version, despite the fact that leaving the country of one's own free will is substantively different than being banished.\n\n     The postscript does not appear in any of the other variants that Tang Kristensen collected, and appears to be an attempt by Margrete to anchor the ballad in the local landscape. Tang Kristensen interprets Klasholm in the manuscript's postscript as the castle \"Klavsholm.\" Klavsholm (or Clausholm) lies midway between Randers and \u00c5rhus in Jutland, and was built by Chancellor Conrad Reventlow in the 1690s. His daughter, Anna Sophie, was kidnapped from Clausholm by the love struck King Frederik IV in 1712, after she had been imprisoned in the castle by her mother. Frederik married her in 1721, after the death of his wife, Queen Louise. He subsequently had Anna Sophie crowned queen. When he died in 1730 at Odense Castle, she was banished to Clausholm, where she lived out her days as a widow, dying in 1743. \n\n     Rosenholm castle was built in the 1670s by Chancellor of the Realm J\u00f8rgen Rosenkrantz, and the castle and its lands are still administered by the same family (18th generation). The family name figures prominently in Shakespeare's Hamlet, along with another Danish noble family name, Gyldenstierne, appearing in Shakespeare's play as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\n     While the ballad may refer in an obscure fashion to the relationship between Anna Sophie and Frederik IV (1671-1730), there is no direct historical connection between their affair and Rosenholm castle or the Rosenkrantz family. More than likely, Margrete connected the ballad to stories she had heard about Frederik IV, Anna Sophie and Clausholm. Once she had narratively sent Gulenborg to Klavsholm, she needed to find an appropriate place to send Hr. Ridebold. Since Rosenholm was the grandest castle she knew, playing as it did a significant role in the economic landscape where she lived, she connected the protagonist of the ballad to it. Klavsholm would have been equally known to her. The connection between the castle and Frederik IV may have resonated with her own alleged connection to the royal court of Frederik VI, the great-grandson of Christian VI, who was the son of Frederik IV by a different mother.", "danish_manuscript": "Hr.
