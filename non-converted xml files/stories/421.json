The count approaches Kristen with the proposition of a paid fight, although the implication is that the count views the fight almost as if it were part of Kristen's villeinage. Kristen knows he has the upper hand in this negotiation, and repeats the common complaint of farm workers that he is neither fed well enough nor housed well enough (PJ 2.26). \n\n     Unlike most aristocrats, the count turns out to be quite generous, interested only in the (Danish) victory, and offers to pay Kristen the proceeds from the bet. In other variants, the bet is smaller (JAH II 412) or the pay out is forgiveness of Kristen's outstanding farm debt (JAH II 414). This latter version has Kristen then entering the newly emergent class of smallholders, a significant change in status for him. In this context, it is worth noting that Kristen only gains his financial independence through a game of chance; despite strength, and obvious prowess on the farm as attested in the second story, Kristen would not otherwise have a chance to earn the money necessary to become independent. The story can be read as a rather depressing commentary on the structure of the Danish rural economy.\n\n      The victory of the Danish strongman over the English strongman likely reflects the bitterness that Danes still felt over the defeat of the Danish navy and the bombardment of Copenhagen by the Brits in 1807. The subsequent downward spiral of the Danish kingdom in European politics and trade still resonated throughout Denmark up through the nineteenth century. Against a backdrop of repeated setbacks to an army composed almost entirely of peasants, including resounding defeat at the hands of the English and the Prussians, a victory of a Danish farmhand over an English strongman must have had clear appeal.\n\n     In another variant of this story, told by J. Jensen from Refshaleg\u00e5rd, the count is identified as the lord at Frisenborg (Frijsenborg) (JA II 412). Frisenborg is approximately four kilometers north-east of Voldby. The farms at Voldby, prior to the partitioning of fields, would have belonged to Frisenborg. Tang Kristensen includes this identification of the count in Peder's story even though it does not appear in the manuscript.\n\n     The grevskab (countship) at Frisenborg was established in 1672, and included lands valued at 22,000 barrels of hartkorn, spread across four districts (amt). It was the largest estate in Denmark at the time. In the 1860s, the count, a konseilspr\u00e6sident and accordingly a politically powerful figure (as a senior member of the parliament), rebuilt the main building. The farm is still privately held by Count Bent Wedell. In the mid twentieth century, his father acquired through marriage another manor farm, Wedellsborg, in western Fyn. The holdings now play a major role in Danish agriculture and forestry.\n\n     Tang Kristensen made minor changes in the published version, particularly in the short, humorous story at the end, deleting Kristen's direct speech. Perhaps Tang Kristensen wanted to paint a picture of Kristen as a man of few words.", "danish_manuscript": "Kristen S\u00f8 han kunde tage Hammel Kirkeklok\nke og staa og ringe imellem hans Ben, og den\nvar endda saadan at der skulde 6 Karle til\nat mure den op i Tallev\u00e6rk da de var\nf\u00e6rdige ved at mure.
