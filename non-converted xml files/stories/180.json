Witnessing the dance can be quite dangerous, since it can make a person elf wild (DS I 748 and 756). In this story, the dance is not particularly threatening, and the man has a mundane and utterly nonthreatening conversation with the mound dweller. The dance appears to be more of a going-away party than anything else.\n\n     There are also numerous stories about the mound dwellers moving (DS I 1341). Often they move to distant countries (DS I 1340). Moving because of the ringing of the church bells is also widely attested (DS I 1356). Other stories suggest that the mound dwellers moved because people had made it impossible for them to steal (DS I 1354). Religious symbols--bells, praying and making the sign of the cross--mark the landscape as Christian, making it impossible for the supernatural beings to remain within it. \n\n     Jens Peter uses the unusual designation bj\u00e6rgtrolde (mound trolls) to describe the mound dwellers, although he reverts to the more common bj\u00e6rgfolk (mound folk) in his second reference. The term \"trold\" draws a linguistic connection between these creatures and the witch in the preceding story (since witchcraft was legally referred to as trolddom), and emphasizes the connection between them and the devil. The close connection to the devil explains why the ringing of the bells and the sign of the cross are efficacious in driving them away.", "danish_manuscript": "Der er en H\u00f8j \u00f8sten for Hj\u00f8rring lige ned-\nden for den \u00f8stre Plantage, den kaldes\n\n7807A\nFremh\u00f8j.
