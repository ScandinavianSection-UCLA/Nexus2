The first part is similar to stories classified as ATU 1359, Husband Outwits Adulteress and Lover, although in the manuscript version, the wife colludes with the husband. The Jewish peddler is simply led to believe that he is going to sleep with the farmer's wife. \n\n     The wandering merchant or peddler is well known in Danish tradition, and appears in both legend and folktales. Many of these peddlers are identified as Jewish peddlers (J\u00f8de kr\u00e6mmer). While the population of Jews in Denmark was never very large, many Jews in Denmark made their living in trade, both large and small scale. The history of Jews in Denmark is fairly complex, and laws pertaining to Jews often distinguished between Sephardic Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former receiving better treatment under the law. The first ordinance governing Jews in Denmark was promulgated February 2, 1651, by King Frederik III, in part deporting all Jews who had immigrated illegally. \n\n     Jens's story is similar to Peder Johansen's story of the farms at Heaven and Hell (PJ 1.02), particularly in the later episode where the jealous, wealthy neighbor believes their poor neighbor has been measuring money with a grain scoop. The fatal advice that the poor farmers give their neighbor is perhaps even more sadistic--and certainly more obscene--than the corresponding episode in Peder Johansen's story.\n\n     Jens reveals a great mastery of storytelling in this account, blending aspects of the humorous jocular tale, with the more believable legend and the utterly fictional folktale. References to place names, named individuals, and technology--such as the type of plow the poor sister used--play on the concept of believability, while the episode of self-mutilation and the minister relies on an absurd suspension of disbelief. The hat made from the woman's genitalia, and the man's subsequent strangulation, move the story firmly into the realm of the burlesque. The absurd final reference at the end to a series of subsequent owners of the ropes made from the hat can only be seen as Jens's own amusing meta-narrative commentary on performance.\n\n      Tang Kristensen plays rather fast and loose with the manuscript version of this story, separating it into two different accounts, the first part published as JAH V 505, and the second part remaining unpublished. JAH V 505 follows the fair copy of the story, indexed as \u00c6v. 1247, J\u00f8dekr\u00e6mmeren, until the wandering merchant is chased down to Gravlev. Tang Kristensen publishes a modified version of the second part of the story as JAH I 212 (BJK 1.20), adding the opening line \"as a satire about the previously used tool.\" Interestingly, that line refers to a story told by Kristen Kristensen Smed (JA H I 211), and not a story told by Jens. Indeed, Jens makes no other mention of leather straps or ropes in his storytelling.\n\n     In the published version of the first part of this story, Tang Kristensen adds the short sentence about the merchant losing all his possessions. To make matters more absurd, he also adds a long note after the published version of this story concerning both the injustices directed at wandering merchants and the dubious nature of many of these same merchants. Although the note encapsulates much of the debate over rural poverty and the status of wandering mendicants, particularly the kr\u00e6mmere but, by extension, the rakkere and natmandsfolk, it is utterly misplaced: \"When we hear about all the injustice and violence that have been directed at these wandering merchants, we cannot be entirely silent concerning these people's crass behavior. A large number of other fairytales and jocular legends indicate that it was not rare nor even uncommon for things to go as described above, and these descriptions seem to be in many ways taken directly from lived experiences. The merchants should not be considered as totally innocent victims, and many of them have at the very least lived a loose life. When I was a young man, a merchant managed in a quite tricky manner to get me to hide some wares for him. I had no idea there was something suspicious about this and didn't suffer any consequences, but he naturally enjoyed taking advantage of my trust and my sympathy for his difficult lot.\" The note, however profoundly felt, is disingenuous, given Tang Kristensen's overt manipulation of his source. It is possible that he wanted to cover his tracks, and added this unusual editorial, to further deflect attention from his manipulation. The story Jens tells is not about the poor lot of the wandering merchants, but rather a humorous and obscene tale about sibling rivalry gone amok.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var to S\u00f8stre der boede i Oplev, den 1 var ri\nog den 2 fattig.

They lived in Jens Markussen\u2019s and Anders Jensen\u2019s farm, the two southern farms. The poor one was a such a pretty young woman, and the other one was a little bit older. They had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, when they plowed, at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they weren\u2019t plowing, they didn\u2019t have anyone there. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to harrow with the nags herself and when they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the livestock. So one day this Jewish wandering merchant comes to the poor sister when she\u2019d just come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn\u2019t going to buy anything since she didn\u2019t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she\u2019d probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn\u2019t any, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really was interested in them, but that didn\u2019t really help matters, since she didn\u2019t have anything to pay for them with. Wouldn\u2019t get any. Then he gets her to try something on: here\u2019s a piece of clothing that he\u2019d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jews often wanted to do that. She didn\u2019t dare do that, she said, because when her husband saw it, he\u2019d want to know where she\u2019d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn\u2019t have any money. Then he takes his wallet up with all these silver coins in it and tosses a shilling to her, she could have it and her husband wouldn\u2019t need to know. When the woman saw that he had all these silver coins she looked at the sun and said, \u201cNo, it's noon now and my husband will come home. But I have another idea. Tonight he\u2019s going to the mill to get grain for the nags. You should come then and ask for lodgings for the night, then we\u2019ll work it out.\u201d He thought this was a great idea. She talks to her husband about this and said that he had all this money, and that it would be good to get a hold of the money since it was tight for them. She\u2019d convinced him. Now you should stand out in the entry and greet him, and she\u2019d listen to their conversation. Well, then the wandering merchant came and wanted lodgings for the night there, it looked like they could. No, their apartment wasn\u2019t large enough to offer people lodgings. Sure, they had enough room, he knew the place well. But they didn\u2019t have anything to put on the bed, no he\u2019d better go to the inn \u2013 there was an inn in Gravlev at that time. No, he had to head west the next morning. Well, then the husband finally let the wife take care of it. She was also hard to convince, but he was finally given permission. Then the husband puts on his long jacket, puts a sack under his arm and grabs a staff and asks his wife to feed the nags one more time, and then she was going to make an evening snack for the wandering merchant. After she\u2019d fed the merchant, they were going to go to bed. That was the most important thing. The her husband comes running in through the kitchen door with a club. The wife had been careful to tell the merchant he could put his goods in that old chest and she gave him the key, and then they went to bed. Now the husband starts beating the poor merchant. The wife she wailed that he shouldn\u2019t beat him like that. He was going to kill them both. She manages to start fighting with him and the merchant grabs his clothes and runs out the door, which her husband had opened. Her husband runs after him and chases him down to the little woods in Gravlev. So the next morning, they were going to open the chest and look through the merchant\u2019s wares, and they find a purse filled with silver coins. We can\u2019t count them, said the wife, but I\u2019ll go over to my sister and borrow her quarter measure, I think there\u2019s a whole quarter measure, we can measure the money there. What do you want it for? You don\u2019t have anything to measure. I want to measure my money. Have you gotten a hold of so many of them. So she gets it and goes home. Something glistens. It is a tiny little shilling from L\u00fcbek, and was so careless that some of them got stuck between the tangs. The sister is curious and finds the money. I have them, there is money. Where did you get them from? I\u2019ll tell you how it is. I had my husband cut my thingy out and had the girl bring it up to the minister and I got a whole quarter measure of money for it. That was quite a good price, do you think he\u2019d buy more? Yes, she figured he would. Well, she didn\u2019t really need any money, but she wanted more, and so hers too. Got her husband to take his straight-razor and sent the hired girl off with it on a white plate with a little napkin over it and up to the minister. Does he buy pussies? What did you say? Says it again. Let me see. The Devil take me, people are becoming completely stupid, they take my cows and leave me the mule. The hired girl gets so scared hearing the minister swear like that that she runs home and by that time the woman was dead. Then her husband felt that you couldn\u2019t just throw something like that away, and he figured he could make a nice cap out of it. They used to wear fox caps at the time. So he wore it to church one day and on the way home there was quite a rain storm, and it got so big that it plopped down around his neck. The hired girl had really heated up the house and so he sat down to warm himself up and as it dried out it shrunk around his neck and strangled him.  Then they had to cut it off of his neck and then they tossed it out onto the dung heap. Another man came to the farm, and it was their habit that they\u2019d drive dung out in the spring and he finds this thing in the dung heap. He figures he could make a set of reigns out of it \u2013 that\u2019s what they said back then, they used leather ropes, they were made just like hemp ropes are nowadays, and they used those as far back as I can remember, and when they\u2019d driven them to pieces and they could use them as plow guides, they had yokes or harnesses and pillows on the horses. And so he has four of these ropes made, and drives off to Nibe to get a load of herring, as was the custom in those days when he\u2019d planted. And so it gets on toward night and he\u2019s had several big drinks down there and it was night before he came back from the town. So when he was driving and got to Uslev, there\u2019s a big hill south of the town that he had to go up, he got down off the wagon and walked alongside it. It started to rain really hard. After he\u2019d gotten a ways, he decided to get back up and drive again, but the wagon was gone and he couldn\u2019t see anything on the horses except these pillows and the empty harness and it was raining and it was really dark. He had no idea what to do, so he got up on the left side horse and rode home. When he gets home, he takes the pillows and harnesses off the horses, and hung them on these large wooden hooks on the north side of the barn, that\u2019s where they hung their equipment (tack) when they came home from the fields in the spring, and he goes in and tells his wife what had happened, and that he\u2019d have to go and get the wagon, but it would have to wait until morning, since the weather was so bad. Then around dawn, it became really windy and dry, and as the ropes dried the wagon came rolling in. By the time it was 10 in the morning, his wagon and herring were home, they came right into the farmyard to him. He used those ropes as long as he was the master of the farm and his son Jens N\u00f8rgaard after him. His name was Ellavst, the man who\u2019d had the ropes made. They say after his mother. He had a son El Jens. When Peder Tygesen became the master there he had enough to use for tying his thresher.", "danish_publication": "Der boede to s\u00f8stre her i Oplev, den ene var rig, og den anden fattig.

De havde ingen folk uden en t\u00f8s til at kj\u00f8re ploven, n\u00e5r de plovede, for den gang brugte de jo de gamle hjulplove med fire for. N\u00e5r der skulde harves, m\u00e5tte konen selv ud med krikkerne, for de havde ikke pigen til hj\u00e6lp, uden n\u00e5r de plovede.

S\u00e5 kom der en j\u00f8dekr\u00e6mmer en dag ind til den fattige s\u00f8ster, da hun var kommen hjem af marken, og han viser jo hans kram an og vil handle med hende. Hun sagde nej, hun skulde ikke handle, for hun havde ingen penge. Men han sagde, at hun skulde lede omkring i den gamle j\u00e6rnbundne kiste, der stod der inde, s\u00e5 fandt hun nok nogle. Nej, der var ingen, det vidste hun nok. N\u00e5, han viste hende jo \u00e9t p\u00e6nt kl\u00e6de efter et andet, som kr\u00e6mmerne plejer. Ja, hun havde lyst nok til dem, men det kunde nu ikke hj\u00e6lpe. S\u00e5 ser han noget vist p\u00e5 hende og siger: her var et kl\u00e6de, som han vilde give hende, om han m\u00e5tte ligge ved hende et bitte korn. Deher j\u00f8dekr\u00e6mmere havde jo og lyst til det. Det turde hun ikke, for n\u00e5r manden fik at se, hun havde det kl\u00e6de, s\u00e5 vilde han have at vide, hvor det var kommet fra, han vidste jo, hun havde ingen penge. S\u00e5 tager han hans pung op med s\u00e5 mange s\u00f8lvpenge i og flyer hende en skilling, den m\u00e5tte hun have, s\u00e5 manden vidste det ikke. Da konen s\u00e5, at kr\u00e6mmeren havde de mange s\u00f8lvpenge, sa hun til solen og sagde: \"Nej, det er nu middag, og s\u00e5 kommer manden hjem. Men a v\u00e9d et andet r\u00e5d, i aften skal han til m\u00f8lle og hente korn til krikkerne, s\u00e5 skal du komme og forlange kvarter, s\u00e5 kan det nok g\u00e5\". Det forslag tykte han godt nok om. Hun snakker med manden om det og forestiller ham, at det var godt at f\u00e5 fat i de penge. \"Nu skal du st\u00e5 ude i frammerset og tage imod ham, og s\u00e5 skal du gj\u00f8re dig f\u00e6rdig, som om du vil til m\u00f8lle\". N\u00e5, s\u00e5 kom kr\u00e6mmeren og vilde have kvarter der. Nej, det var deres lejlighed ikke til at have s\u00e5danne folk i kvarter, siger manden. Ja, de havde plads nok, han var godt tjent med det. Men de havde heller ikke noget at l\u00e6gge p\u00e5 sengen, nej, han fik at g\u00e5 til kroeret \u2014 der var kro i Gravlev den gang. Nej, det kunde han ikke, for han skulde vester p\u00e5 n\u00e6ste morgen. Ja, s\u00e5 overlod manden det til sidst til konen. Hun var ogs\u00e5 str\u00e6ng at komme af sted med, men omsider fik han lov. S\u00e5 tr\u00e6kker manden i hans lange tr\u00f6je, f\u00e5r en s\u00e6k under armen og kj\u00e6p i h\u00e5nden og beder konen om at give krikkerne en gang, og s\u00e5 skulde hun jo lave noget n\u00e6tter til kr\u00e6mmeren. Men det tog tid, og manden kom hjem, inden de var helt f\u00e6rdige. Kr\u00e6mmeren var endda kommen i seng, og nu klistrer manden p\u00e5 den arme kr\u00e6mmer. Konen hun hv\u00e6lld, at han m\u00e5tte ikke sl\u00e5 ham s\u00e5dan. Jo, han havde st\u00e5et uden for og h\u00f8rt, hvad han havde snakket med hans kone om, og nu skulde de sl\u00e5es ihjel begge to. Hun f\u00e5r da mon til at f\u00e5 i kj\u00e6p med ham, og kr\u00e6mmeren f\u00e5r hans kl\u00e6der under armen og ud ad d\u00f6ren, som manden havde sl\u00e5et op. Men manden bag efter ham og jager ham ned i krattet ved Gravlev. S\u00e5 slap han med livet, men hans penge havde han mist og hans kramkiste med, det turde han ikke hente siden.\n     ETK: N\u00e5r vi h\u00f8rer om al den uret og alle de voldshandlinger, der er blevet \u00f8vede imod de omvandrende kr\u00e6mmere, m\u00e5 vi ej heller v\u00e6re aldeles tavse med hensyn til selve disses r\u00e5 f\u00e6rd. Ti at den undertiden og endda vel ej sj\u00e6lden har v\u00e6ret som oven for skildret, tyder en stor del andre skj\u00e6mtende fort\u00e6llinger og \u00e6ventyr p\u00e5, og de synes at v\u00e6re i mange tr\u00e6k som grebne lige ud af livet. Kr\u00e6mmerne skal da ej st\u00e5 som helt br\u00f8defri v\u00e6sener, og et l\u00f8st liv har mange af dem i alt fald f\u00f8rt. Da jeg var et ungt menneske, fik en krammer mig p\u00e5 en ret snedig m\u00e5de til at hj\u00e6lpe sig at gjemme noget kram. Jeg anede ikke, at der var noget misligt derved og kom da heller ingen ulempe i, men han har naturligvis gottet sig over min godtroenhed og medynk med hans vanskelige f\u00e6rd.", "english_publication": "There were two sisters who lived here in Oplev, one was rich and the other was poor. They lived in Jens Markussen\u2019s and Anders Jensen\u2019s farms, the two southern farms. The rich one was the oldest and the poor one was a such a pretty young woman. When the poor sister plowed, they had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, since at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to go herself with the nags, since they didn\u2019t have a girl there except when they plowed. When they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the cattle. This Jewish wandering merchant came one day to the poor sister when she\u2019d come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn\u2019t going to buy anything since she didn\u2019t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she would probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn\u2019t any. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really wanted them, but that didn\u2019t really help matters. Then he gets her to try something on: here\u2019s a piece of clothing that he\u2019d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jewish wandering merchants liked to do that too. She didn\u2019t dare do that, because when her husband saw that she had the clothing, then he\u2019d want to know where she\u2019d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn\u2019t have any money. Then he takes his wallet up with all these silver coins in it and tosses a shilling to her, she could have it and her husband wouldn\u2019t need to know. When the woman saw that he had so many silver coins she looked at the sun and said, \u201cNo, it's noon now and my husband will come home. But I have another idea. Tonight he is going to the mill to get grain for the nags, then you should come and ask for shelter, and it will probably work out.\u201d He liked this suggestion. She talks to her husband about this and tells him that it would be good to get a hold of the money. \u201cNow you should stand out in the entry and greet him, and then you should get ready like you were going to the mill.\u201d Well, then the wandering merchant came and wanted shelter there. No, their apartment wasn\u2019t large enough to give people shelter there. Sure, they had enough room, he knew the place well. But they didn\u2019t have anything to put on the bed, no he\u2019d better go to the inn \u2013 there was an inn in Gravlev at that time. No, he couldn\u2019t do that, because he had to head west the next morning. Well, then the husband finally let the wife take care of it. She was also hard to convince, but he was finally given permission. Then the husband puts on his long jacket, puts a sack under his arm and grabs a staff and asks his wife to feed the nags one more time, and then she was going to make some evening snacks for the wandering merchant. But it took a while and they weren\u2019t done before the husband came home. The wandering merchant still had just gotten into bed, and now the husband grabs hold of the poor merchant. The wife wailed that he shouldn\u2019t beat him like that. Well, he\u2019d been standing outside and heard what he\u2019d talked about to his wife and now he was going to kill them both. She runs at him to fight with him and the merchant grabs his clothes and runs out the door, which the man had opened. The husband ran after him and chases him down to the little woods in Gravlev. So he escaped with his life, but he\u2019d lost his money and his box of wares too, and he didn\u2019t dare go back to get it.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["Anders Jensen", "arms", "bed", "box", "cattle", "chase", "chest", "clothing", "coins", "day", "door", "escape", "evening", "farm", "feed", "field", "fight", "girl", "grain", "harrow", "home", "husband", "inn", "iron", "Jens Markussen", "Jews", "kill", "merchant", "mill", "money", "morning", "nag", "noon", "old", "outside", "permission", "plow", "plowing", "poor", "rich", "shilling", "silver", "sister", "south", "sun", "tonight", "wallet", "wandering", "wandering merchant", "wares", "west", "wheel", "wife", "woman", "woods", "work", "young"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Livet uden d\u00f8re", "heading_english": "Life outdoors"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
