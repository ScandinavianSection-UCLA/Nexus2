She got pregnant by him, but one evening there was a dance, it was at Christmastime, then she danced so much with my father that she had the child the next day, and the baby died. She and Kr\u00e6n Raadsig were married a little after that and lived down in Bindslev parish. Then there was another farmhand who also worked in the parsonage, he was from Burskov in Ugilt, and Kr\u00e6n Raadsig borrowed twenty-five daler from him. The parsonage madam was in on borrowing the money from him. Then this farmhand is drafted and has to go to Copenhagen but he doesn\u2019t get the money before he leaves. Half a year later, he gets sick, winds up in the infirmary and dies. Well, the people at the parsonage inquire about his death in Copenhagen but they don\u2019t do anything about paying the money back to his heirs. The madam especially should have taken care of this, and the farmhand\u2019s family believed that the money had been paid and nobody could have believed otherwise. It is like this for a month but then a white ghost appears in the scullery of the parsonage, and the girls were terribly afraid of it. It continued to walk about out there every night for eight days, and the madam heard about it. Then one night she goes down there just at the moment it tended to come because she was going to show that she dared to go down there, she said. But then it took hold of her and squeezed her, and she got sick. Then the minister learned about this and he went down there the next evening and talked to it, and the next day they made good on the twenty-five daler. After that they didn\u2019t see the ghost again and there was peace at the farm.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["afraid", "baby", "baptism", "belief", "borrow", "children", "Christmas", "daler", "dancing", "daughter", "day", "death", "evening", "family", "farm", "farmhand", "father", "ghost", "girl", "Kristine", "Kr\u00e6n Raadsig", "learning", "marriage", "minister", "money", "month", "night", "parish", "parsonage", "Pastor H\u00f8eg", "pregnant", "scullery", "sickness", "white", "year"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Forskjelligt sp\u00f8geri og gjenf\u00e6rds nedmaning", "heading_english": "Revenants and their conjuring"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
