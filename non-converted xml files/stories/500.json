The other children were not supposed to get any inheritance until their father died, but she had decided that she (the little girl) should have a little more. While she was alive, she had made bedsheets for the children, just like other people, and then she had sewn a little leather pouch in one of the corners. In the leather pouch she had hidden four hundred daler for her, but it hadn\u2019t yet been revealed. Then she came many nights when it was twelve o\u2019clock, and went and stood by these sheets. They locked up as best they could at night, but she came in anyways. The husband woke several times and saw her, and they were so afraid of her. They had noticed that she stood and picked at this comforter and they tore it open. Then they found a little note with the girl\u2019s name on it and then they found the leather pouch and opened it up.
