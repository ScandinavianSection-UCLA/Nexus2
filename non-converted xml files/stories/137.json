The implication in her response to the fourth commandment is that her father was a serious criminal, likely a murderer, and that her mother was a witch (hence the burning). The order of the ten commandments follows that in Martin Luther's small catechism, and is based on Deuteronomy 5:6-21. Other versions of the commandments can be found in Exodus 20:2-17 and Exodus 34:12-26. The first volume of Kuri\u00f8se Overh\u00f8ringer does not number the stories.
