The story is similar to the earlier version, and confirms that legend (and personal experience narrative) can be crystallized in performance (Tangherlini 2003; Siikala 1990). Despite the crystallization, there are certain changes: the order of unbound phrases, place names, and word choice have all been slightly altered (Labov and Waletzky 1967). The etiological tag that explains how the church got its name, and how the mound came into being, remains a prominent feature of the story.\n\n     In the previous telling, Kirsten Marie had used the words \"joor\" and \"boor,\" which were normalized to \"jord\" and \"b\u00e5rer\" for \"earth\" and \"fallow fields.\" In this telling, she substitutes the word \"h\u00e5r'e\" (=h\u00e5rde) for \"joor\" and the word \"b\u00e5re\" for \"boor.\" It may well be that Tang Kristensen normalized the spelling while writing, as he does not appear to be concerned with noting dialect or alternate pronunciations in this particular recording. The substitution of h\u00e5rde for jord makes the interpretation of the mound woman's appeal easier: here she asks that he ride on the hard--presumably the road or path--and not on the fields.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var en G. en Karl kom ridende forbi et Bj\u00e6rg\npaa Tendrup Mark de kalder det Hvonbj\u00e6rget.\nS. kom der en fin Dame rendende ud fra\nBj\u00e6rget og bad ham holde, mens hu skj\u00e6nkede\nham en snaps.
