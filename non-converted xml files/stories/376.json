Not surprisingly, the people at the farm turn to several local ministers to solve the problem, a fairly standard strategy for dealing with haunts, despite the seeming incongruity of Lutheran ministers dealing with a threat (ghosts) that should have disappeared with the Reformation (Tangherlini 1999). The ministers' failure can be read as a stinging indictment of the power of the minister and, by extension, the Lutheran church. In contrast, the beggar, who has no social standing and whose name, Klemmen Unborn, suggests a supernatural liminality, succeeds. The nickname probably refers to his birth by Caesarian section, an operation that was known as early as the sixteenth century when it was used to deliver children whose mothers had died during childbirth (see KMP 1.05). The standing offer of shelter at the manor parallels other stories in which a beggar offers unusual assistance and is rewarded with food and lodgings (see KMP 2.08).\n\n     The published version of the story eliminates the clear narrative connection that Peder makes between this story and the preceding one.", "danish_manuscript": "S. er der en Herregrd her inde \u00f8sterpaa de\nkaldte Stadsgaard, og de kalder den for Re-\nsten saadan endnu.
