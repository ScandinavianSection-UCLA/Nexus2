The Cyprianus, a book of magic spells and incantations, was considered to be a source of power in and of itself (Davies 2009, 123-132). It was closely related to the devil, and both witches and cunning folk, as well as wise ministers, were said to have possessed the book. Many cunning folk based their practice on ownership of the book alone (R\u00f8rbye 1976).  In many stories, the book is used expertly to conjure ghosts, while in other stories, less than expert use of the book results in misfortune from the insignificant, as in this brief account, to utter calamity (JPP 2.06 and 4.20). \n\n     Narratively, Jens Peter brings the Cyprianus into his immediate sphere, indicating his own willingness to possess the book. In many stories, the Cyprianus is difficult to get rid of: it cannot be burned (DS VI 216), and it reappears even if one has tried to get rid of it (DS VI 222).\n\n     Tang Kristensen collected copies of the Cyprianus, acquiring them whenever he had the chance. In Minder og Oplevelser, he writes about one of his copies of the book that was in a museum display in Copenhagen: \"men betingede mig, at den skulde l\u00e6gges saadan, at Folk ikke kunde komme til at blade i den eller overhovedet r\u00f8re ved den. Det gik han ind paa, og der blev da lavet en Glaskasse til den, som den laa i og saadan opslaaet, at det Blad, hvorpaa der med r\u00f8de Bogstaver var pr\u00e6ntet Cyprianus, laa til Syne.\" [but I added the condition that it should be displayed in such a way that people could not browse in it or even manage to touch it. He went along with that, and a glass case was made for it, in which it lay opened to the page where the word Cyprianus was printed in red letters] (MO III 174). While Tang Kristensen was worried that his book would be damaged, he was equally worried that the contents of the book were dangerous (Rockwell 1982, 167 and 208).", "danish_manuscript": "Knold Kr\u00e6n havde Ceperaanus og havde\nfaaet den inde i Torslev ved en Mand\nder havde 4.
