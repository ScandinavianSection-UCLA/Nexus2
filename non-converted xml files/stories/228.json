Deaf Lars's status is only incrementally better than that of a beggar. Many poor people survived partly through begging and partly through doing small jobs such as glazing, which were not prohibited by the trade laws. Glarmesterfolk (glaziers) was a common appellation for itinerant tinkerers and along with tatere (gypsies) and natmandsfolk (refuse collectors, literally \"nightmen\"), glarmesterfolk were often lumped under the overarching category of k\u00e6ltringer. This category included vagabonds, itinerant tinkerers and beggars. The word \"k\u00e6ltringer\" later became synonymous with \"con artists\" (Gaardboe 1968, 12-13). \n\n     Sidsel Rollands' status as a wandering beggar--and a loose woman-- also aligns well with Kirsten Marie's critical stories about beggars and members of poorer classes. In this case, the beggars are represented not only as free riders, but also as dangerous con artists.\n\n     The hare that Sidsel allegedly sees would be a \"milk hare,\" a common figure for witches either to assume or to send to collect milk from local farms (DS VII 268 and 584). Witches often steal milk and cream, perhaps the clearest manifestation of an economic product derived primarily from female coded activity, from all the local farms for their own personal gain (DS VII 576). \n\n     The farmer and his wife appeal to the community for help to pay for Sidsel's services. While she pretends to protect the farm (and by extension the community) from the threat of the witch and milk hare, she herself is actually the threat. This narrative switch is the crux of the story, where the protector turns out to be the threatener.\n\n     The prohibition against talking about the alleged cure is reminiscent of prohibitions against speaking while seeking buried treasure, an act that separates the treasure diggers from the human community (PJ 2.09). Here, the silence guarantees Sidsel some time to work her con. She even alludes to burying the money as a prophylactic against the return of the hare. It is worth noting that Sidsel, unlike the witch, steals money, a reflection of the rapid shift away from an informal economy based largely on real goods, toward a thoroughly monetized economy: This shift took place in the last decades of the nineteenth century in rural Denmark.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i M\u00f8rke og der kom D\u00f8ve Lars og en \nKj\u00e6lling h. havde til at ligge om Natten.\nh. var vist ikke gift med hende, for h. var\nskilt med hans rigtige Kone.

Sure. \"What is it you've been talking about? Are we unlucky?\" Then Sidsel said yes. \"What should we do?\" Well, she'd tell them what to do. They should dig a hole by their bed, and she should be given 20 rixdollars, but they couldn't tell anybody about it. Then they went around in town and borrowed the money and started to dig near the bed, and there she found, so she made it seem, a mole skin that was filled with stones.
