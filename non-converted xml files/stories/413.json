Witchcraft is always exercised for personal gain and always harms people in the community, either physically, economically, or both. Cunning, in contrast, is always used to protect the community from outside threat, be it a threat to property or to physical well being. \n\n     There were two classes of cunning folk: ministers, and lay persons. Here, the minister uses his cunning to protect his own apples from theft. The apples represent a modest, but important part of the agricultural income that was a component of his compensation.\n\n     That the thief is someone from the community calls to mind the image of the witch, who likewise steals from community members, and who is often confronted by the minister. Unlike the witch in the previous story, the thief is duly chastised by the local authorities, here in the guise of the minister.\n\n     Ane Margrete Jensdatter tells a story of another wise minister who was similarly able to use his cunning for the benefit of the community (AMJ 1.06).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand i Blegind h. gaar op til\nPr\u00e6stens flere N\u00e6tter og tog af \u00c6blerne, de hav-\nde s. meget nogle gode \u00c6bler.
