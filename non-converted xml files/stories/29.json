Not only does he threaten the livelihood of the local farmers in life, but he continues to do so after death. Jens provided no detail as to how the revenant was dealt with. The reference to Mylius likely was triggered by mention of Stubberuphus in the previous story, where the unfortunate Hoffman lived. That reference also explains this seeming digression (Georges 1983). Presumably, it is a duel between Mylius and Hoffman that leads to Hoffman's death. \n\n     Collapsing independent landholdings into one large manor farm was a practice that ended by the late eighteenth century and was, in fact, reversed through partitioning. There had been a long standing prohibition against deserting hearths to prevent the abandonment of land, and to prevent exactly the type of consolidation that Mylius attempts in this story.\n\n     In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen combined and rearranged BJK 1.26 and BJK 1.27 into a single narrative.", "danish_manuscript": "Ham den gl. der byggede [paa] Mylenbj\u00e6rg, h. kj\u00f8rte igien\nefter hans D\u00f8d, de kaldte det f\u00f8r Skjelhusene.\nmen h. vilde gj\u00f8re det til en stor Grd. kommer\ntil visse Tider med 4 sorte for.

Of course, he had to build just as many houses as there\u2019d been farms, they weren\u2019t allowed to desert hearths like that, but he got the land. Then when Mylius became owner of the farms, he made them sign papers that allowed him to take any of their property that hindered him. After that, he took the meadows from these copyholders and gave them some heath instead. The old copyholders had had permission to graze their animals in the woods, but he forbade them that as well.
