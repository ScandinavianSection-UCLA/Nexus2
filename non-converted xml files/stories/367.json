Intriguingly, the story is told in the first person from the perspective of a man. This choice of narrator underscores the fictional nature of the account. \n\n     Several of the characters resonate with other stories in Margrete's repertoire: the boy's acquisition of magical abilities parallels the boy who learns the three crafts; and the antagonists (the mound man and the dragon) appear in many of Margrete's legends. \n\n     Mikkelr\u00e6v, or Michael Fox, is a well-known trickster figure in Danish fairy tales, but here he plays little more than a helper figure role. Hunt privileges in the forests were strictly limited to large landowners, a privilege that became a point of contention in the years after the constitutional reform. Not all nobility and royals were in agreement on their absolute right to hunting privileges and King Frederik VII (1848-1863) gave up his exclusive privileges to the hunt on all royal lands, a gesture that endeared him greatly to the rural populations. The laws governing hunting rights were changed in 1851, eliminating the formerly exclusive rights to the hunt that had accrued to the nobility and royalty.\n\n     The moves in this active masculine tale closely follow those detailed by Holbek (1987,  432). Amusingly, the story does not end with the \"happily ever after\" formula, but rather ends with the hero/narrator flying off to join the geese, only to be deposited back in poverty and the real world.     \n\n     The fair copy version is far more detailed than the manuscript version. Events have been expanded, and occasional plot points have been altered such as the fight with the dragon near the end of the tale, and the early interactions between the young man and the princess in her castle.", "danish_manuscript": "Da a var ude at gj\u00f8re min sidste M\u00f8n-\nstring, da kom Mikkel R\u00e6v til mig\nog spurgte mig om a vilde ikke b\u00e6re ham\n\n6720A\ni min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k lidt for Skytteren de\nvilde skyde ham.

Then he'd grant me three promises. I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck and after we'd gone a little bit the dogs come running after me too and then the hunters come too. They said that I must have some fresh slaughtered meat in my bag. Then I said that I didn't have anything other than the rags that I couldn't sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See then they called their dogs off and then when I'd gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now, because now there wasn't any danger anymore. When he'd left, I wanted to try if there was anything to these promises and so I turned myself into an ant first, but it didn't go far down the road. So I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away to another kingdom and I fell down there right in front of the princess's windows and she had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry and a duck and then she placed the rusks on the table and I went in. She slams the window shut. Not the first but the next night, I wanted to try to lie with her and turned myself into a man. She shouted: Father, father, there is a man with me. He came in there. So I turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. So they couldn't find me. She'd dreamt it. Same way for three nights. Then the king said that if she called him again, she'd be punished. If she wouldn't keep quiet. Then she talked to me. It continued like this for a while. One day the king came in there and she said to him that she wanted to have that bird. You already have it. But I want to have it as my husband. A strange husband. He can also turn himself into a man. I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. Well, since you can do so much, then you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, then you can have her. Well, I didn't know about that. So I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. I came to an inn, they were sitting and talking about this mound dweller, and I learned there where the mountain was. I turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. She was home alone. The mound man was out. Jesus Christ, how did you get in here. Well, I... You're unlucky. In the first room, there was a closet with so many human skulls in it, in the second, a closet with so much clothes, and in the third, so many dead bodies lay. When you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, since he can kill so many people. Then he'll say there is Christian blood in here. You should answer he knows that you are Christian. You have to leave now. No, I'll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, I want to hear how he answers you. Then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Asks him where his heart was. Ugh, there is Christian blood in here. You know that I'm Christian. He gets up and looked in all the rooms. Back into bed again. My heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and that's in a duck, and that's in a fox, and that is in a dragon, and that is at a manor farm and if they don't get it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom. Then I crept up out of the mountain again, and I went to the manor farm and the manor lord. Didn't he need a farmhand. Yes, a swineherd since the dragon laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. When the swine weren't fat enough. You probably don't want to be that. Sure, I can probably lay waste to him. The first day, a Monday, I was to go out, I got seven fat swine to drive. To the dragon. Good day, Dragon. Thank you. Are you to have these. Yes, that's what I've gotten each weekday. Let's fight for them. I turned myself into a lion and then we fight. If only he'd had one of those swine, then he would have torn me into such small pieces that they wouldn't have been able to pick all of me up in eight days. If I'd had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he'd been crushed in a mill. Then I won the swine and came back to the manor lord with them. The manor lord was worried and scared that the dragon would destroy his land and kingdoms. It's good for him to go hungry a bit, I'm a strong young man. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. Good day, Dragon. Thank you... lion... fight... third Monday twenty-one... Manager a bite of bread and a dram along to give me when I asked for it. Then I won the twenty-one fat swine. Then I ripped the dragon to death and a fox came out. Tore apart. Duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. Tore apart. Egg to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got my shoulder sack and the egg in it. The manor lord wanted to give me so much but I wasn't too interested, and I set off to get back to the mound man. He was lying on top and was so sick. Oh dear God, is it you that has my heart? Yes. Oh, can't I have it back? Yes, if you'll send the princess you have down there with you back to land just as nice and healthy as when you took her. Yes, he'd certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Followed her home to her father and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous and I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed onto me, and they flew with me to the third B\u00e6rmose  and then I fell down and that's how I came here and could tell you this lie.", "danish_publication": "Da a var ude at gj\u00e6re min sidste M\u00f8nstring, da kom Mikkel R\u00e6v til mig og spurgte mig, om a vilde ikke b\u00e6re ham lidt i min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k, for Skytterne de vilde skyde ham, saa vilde han give mig tre L\u00f8fter, og det var, te a kunde skabe mig i en Myre, i en L\u00f8ve og i en And. Da vi kommer lidt hen, saa kommer ogsaa Hundene rendende efter mig, og bag efter kommer Skytten jo ogsaa. De sagde, a maatte have noget Ferskeri i min Pose, men a sagde, a havde ikke andet end de Pjalter, a kunde ikke s\u00e6lge og faa noget for, a havde vel Lov til at have i min Pose, hvad a vilde, og de skulde v\u00e6rsgod og snevve deres Hunde. Se, saa snevvede de dem og, og da a saa var kommen lidt l\u00e6ngere hen, saa sagde Mikkel til mig, nu maatte a godt lade ham gaa, for nu var der ingen Fare. Da han saa var kommen af min Pose og rendt hans Vej, vilde a pr\u00f8ve, om der var ogsaa noget ved de L\u00f8fter, han havde givet mig. A skabte mig f\u00f8rst i en Myre, og det gik nu godt nok. Men det saa lidt hen ad Vejen saadan at rende som Myre, og saa skabt a mig i en And og fl\u00f8j saa langt saa langt hen, til a kom i et andet Kongerige. Der faldt a ned lige for Prinsessens V\u00f8nderer, og hun fik mig at se og havde aldrig set saa p\u00e6n en Fugl. Hun lukte V\u00f8nderet op og lagde Tvebakker i Karmen, og a var jo sulten og gav mig til at \u00e6de af dem. Hun lagde Tvebakker paa Bordet, og a fl\u00f8j ind. Saa sm\u00e6kkede hun V\u00f8nderet i, og nu blev a inde ved hende. Den f\u00f8rste Dag blev a ved at v\u00e6re Fugl, men saa den anden Aften vilde a pr\u00f8ve at ligge ved hende og skabte mig da i en Karl igien. Hun raabte: \u201dFader, Fader, der er Mandfolk hos mig!\u201d og han kom jo l\u00f8bende derind, men a skabte mig jo strags i en Myre og satte mig inde under Sengen. Nu kunde de ikke finde mig, og saa sagde Kongen, hun havde dr\u00f8mt det. Saadan bar a mig ogsaa ad den Tredje Aften. Hun kaldte paa hendes Fader og han kom, men a var jo i en Myre og sa under Sengen. Saa sagde Kongen, at hvis hun saadan narrede ham tiere, saa skulde hun have Straf, for han vilde ikke tiere saadan kaldes op. Den Gang a saa havde gjort mig til Karl igien, og hun m\u00e6rkede, a var der, saa snakkede hun til mig, og vi blev da godt kjendt med hinanden. Det stod saa hen et stort Stykke Tid. En Dag Kongen kom derind, saa sagde hun; \u201dA vil have den Fugl.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDen har du jo,\u201d siger han. \u201dJammen, a vil have den til Mand.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDet var da en s\u00e6r Mand,\u201d siger Kongen. Ja-a, han kunde ogsaa skabe sig til Karl. \u201dDet var noget,\u201d siger Kongen, og i det samme gj\u00f8r a mig til Karl, og staar og snakker med dem. \u201dJa, naar du kan saa meget,\u201d siger han, \u201dsaa kan du skaffe den Prinsesse hjem, som Bj\u00e6rgmanden har taget for nogle Aar siden, og naar du kommer med hende, saa skal du faa min Datter.\u201d Ja, det vidste a ikke, om a turde tage mig paa. Jo, det skulde a, nu var Kongen bleven opsat paa det, og saa maa a ud at vandre igjen med min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k paa min Nakke. Endelig kom a til en Kro, hvor de sad og snakkede om den Bj\u00e6rgmand, og der fik a at vide, hvor Bj\u00e6rget var. A kom derhen, skabte mig i en Myre, og kr\u00f8b derned. Lige i Tiden var Prinsessen enlig hjemme, Bj\u00e6rgmanden var et sted henne, hvor det var. \u201dJ\u00f8s Kors hvordan er du kommen her ind?\u201d siger hun. \u2013 Ja, a var da kommen her. \u201dAa, du er ulykkelig,\u201d siger hun, \u201ddu kommer aldrig levende herfra,\u201d og saa viste hun mig ind i det f\u00f8rste V\u00e6relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Menneskehoveder i. Dern\u00e6st kom a ind i det andet V\u00e6relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Kl\u00e6der i, og endelig kom a ind i det tredje hvor der laa saa mange d\u00f8de Kroppe. Saa siger a til hende: \u201dNaar han nu kommer hjem, og du kommer i Seng i Aften, saa skal du sp\u00f8rge ham hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte er, for han maa da ikke have det med sig, siden han kan undlive saa mange.\u201d Ja, det skulde hun nok. Saa vil han vel nok sige: \u201dDer er Kristenblod herinde, men du skal svare ham han ved nok, du er en Kristen.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, du maa afsted nu,\u201d siger Prinsessen til mig og er saa angst. \u201dNej, a s\u00e6tter mig under Sengen i en Myre, for a vil h\u00f8re hvad han svarer dig.\u201d Naa, saa kom Bj\u00e6rgmanden, og de fik deres Aftensmad, og kom saa i Seng. Saa sp\u00f8rger hun ham, hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte var. \"Du maa jo ikke have det ved dig, siden du kan undlive saa mange.\u201d \u2013 \u201dFyfy, der er Kristenblod her inde,\u201d siger han. \u201dAa, du ved nok, a er en Kristen,\u201d siger hun. Men det vilde han ikke give sig tilfreds med, og han op, og de ledte i alle V\u00e6relserne. Men de fandt jo ingen Ting, og han maa til at i Seng igien. Hun sp\u00f8rger atter om, hvor hans Hj\u00e6rte var. \u201dMit Hj\u00e6rte, det kan ingen faa, det er inden i et \u00c6g, og det \u00c6g er i en And, og den And er i en R\u00e6v, og den er inden i en Drage, og den Drage er ved en Herregaard. Hvis de ikke skaffer dem syv fede Svin hver Ugedag, saa l\u00e6gger den Lande og Rige \u00f8de.\u201d Den Gang a havde nu h\u00f8rt det, saa kr\u00f8b a op paa Bj\u00e6rget igien, og a rejste af hen til den Herregaard. A kommer til Herremanden og sp\u00f8rger ham, om han tr\u00e6ngte ingen Karle for. Jo, han tr\u00e6ngte for en Svinhyrde, for der var en Drage, der lagde saa mange Hjorder \u00f8de for ham. Det gjorde han, naar Svinene var ikke fede nok, som han skulde have. \u201dMen den Bestilling vil du vel ikke gj\u00e6rne have.\u201d \u2013 \u201dJo, det er mig det samme,\u201d siger a, \u201da kan nok l\u00e6gge ham \u00f8de.\u201d Naa ja, saa kom a i Pladsen. Den f\u00f8rste Dag, a skulde ud med Svinene, det var en Mandag, og a fik syv fede Svin at drive med. Saa kommer a til Dragen. \u201dGod Dag, Drage,\u201d siger a. \u201dTak,\u201d siger han. \u201dSkal du have dine fede Svin?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, de har a faaet hver Ugedag.\u201d \u2013 \u201dDet vil vi slaas om,\u201d siger a, og saa skaber a mig i en L\u00f8ve og slaas med ham. Endelig siger han: Gud a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have revet dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.\u201d A bad til, a havde haft en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram, saa skulde a have reven ham saa smaa, som han var m\u00f8llemaald. Saa gav han tabt, og a vandt Svinene og kom hjem til Herremanden med dem. Han var s\u00f8rgen og r\u00e6d for Dragen, te den vild l\u00e6gge Lande og Riger \u00f8de for ham, som den havde truet med, men a var jo frisk Karl og viste ham Svinene. \u201dHan har godt af at sulte noget,\u201d siger a. Den n\u00e6ste Mandag skulde Forvalteren med for at se, hvordan det gik til. Da havde a fjorten fede Svin med, for Herremanden var bange for at beholde dem. Saa kom den og var ikke saa meget god. \u201dGod Dag Drage,\u201d siger a. \u201dTak,\u201d siger den. \u201dSkal du have dine fede Svin?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, den kan a nok tr\u00e6nge til.\u201d  \u2013 \u201dJa, det vil vi slaas om,\u201d og a gj\u00f8r mig til en L\u00f8ve og slaas paa Liv og D\u00f8d med ham. Der falder nu den sammen snak imellem os, og det stod Forvalteren jo og h\u00f8rte paa. Endelig blev Dragen kjed af at slaas med mig, og saa drog a hjem med mine svin. Men Herremanden kunde endnu ikke rigtig falde i Ro og han vilde have, a skulde drage af med 21 Svin den n\u00e6ste Mandag. Forvalteren skulde med, og han skulde have en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram med at fly mig, naar a forlangte det. Vi kom saa til at slaas for tredje Gang, og da vi havde slaas paa Liv og D\u00f8d en Tid, saa siger Dragen: \u201dGid a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have reven dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.\u201d Men a sagde; \u201dHavde a nu en Bid Br\u00f8d og en Dram, saa skulde a rive dig saa smaa, som du var m\u00f8llemaald.\u201d Strags springer Forvalteren til og jager det i mig, og saa tog a fat igjen og fik Magt med Dragen, saa nu havde a vundet de 21 fede Svin. A rev Dragen ihjel, og saa kom der en R\u00e6v ud. Den rev a ogsaa ihjel, og saa fl\u00f8j der en And ud af den og satte sig paa en Sten i Havet. A gj\u00f8r mig i en And og flyver ud efer den. A river den ihjel, og saa falder der et \u00c6g ud, og det falder til Havsens Bund. A ned efter det, og saa fik a \u00c6gget i min Tv\u00e6rs\u00e6k og rejser af tilbage til Herremanden. Han vilde have givet mig saa meget, for det a havde frelst ham fra Dragen, men det br\u00f8d a mig ikke om, a satte efter at komme tilbage til Bj\u00e6rget. Da a kom der, laa han ovenpaa og var saa syg. \u201dAa Herre G...,\u201d siger han, \u201der det dig, der har mit Hj\u00e6rte?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJa, det er.\u201d \u2013 \u201dAa, maa a da ikke faa det?\u201d \u2013 \u201dJo, naar du vil fly den Prinsesse i Land, du har her nede ved dig, og det lige saa from og lige saa sund, som da du tog hende.\u201d Jo, det skulde han nok. Saa gik han ned og hent hende og hun kom i Land. Nu fulgte hun med mig hjem til hendes Faders Land, og der blev saadan Gl\u00e6de, da a kom med hende, saa det var farligt. A skulde nu have Prinsessen og det halve Kongerige strags, og det andet halve, naar Kongen d\u00f8de. Men Gud bedre det, dem, der har meget, de vil have mere. Den ottende Dag efter Brylluppt stod a og saa ud over Slottet, og der saa a en Flok Vilgj\u00e6s. A skabte mig saa i en And og fl\u00f8j op og vilde have dem, men saa kom a imellem T\u00f8mmen af dem, og de fl\u00f8j med mig til tredje B\u00e6rmose, og saa faldt a ned. Derfor kom a hertil og kunde fort\u00e6lle jer den L\u00f8gn.", "english_publication": "When I was out doing my last inspection, Michael Fox came up to me and asked me if I couldn\u2019t carry him a bit in my shoulder bag, because the hunters wanted to shoot him, and he\u2019d give me three promises, and they were that I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck. After we\u2019d gone a little bit, the dogs came running after me, and behind them the hunters came too. They said that I must have some freshly slaughtered meat in my bag, but I said that I didn\u2019t have anything other than the rags that I couldn\u2019t sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See, then they called their dogs off and then when I\u2019d gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now because there wasn\u2019t any danger anymore. When he\u2019d gotten out of my bag and run off, I wanted to test if there was anything to these promises he\u2019d given me. I turned myself into an ant first and that went well enough. But I didn\u2019t get far down the road running there like an ant, so I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away until I came to another kingdom. I fell down right in front of the princess\u2019s windows and she saw me and had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry that I started to eat them. She placed the rusks on the table and I flew in. Then she slammed the window shut, and now I was inside with her. The first day I stayed a bird, but then the next night I wanted to try to lie with her and so I turned myself into a man again. She shouted: \u201cFather, father, there is a man here in my room!\u201d and he came running in there, but I immediately turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. Now they couldn\u2019t find me, and then the king said that she\u2019d dreamed it. I did the same thing the third night. She called for her father and he came, but I was an ant and sat under the bed. Then the king said that if she tricked him again, she\u2019d be punished because he didn\u2019t want to be called like that anymore. Then after I\u2019d turned myself into a man again and she noticed that I was there, she talked to me and we got to know each other well. It continued like this for a while. One day when the king had come in there, she said to him, \u201cI want to have that bird.\u201d\u2014\u201cYou already have it,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, but I want to have it as my husband.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a strange husband,\u201d says the king. \u201cYes, well he can also turn himself into a man.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d says the king, and at that moment, I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. \u201cWell, since you can do so much,\u201d he says, \u201cthen you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, and when you come with her, you\u2019ll get my daughter.\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t know if I dared take on that task. Yes, I had to, now the king had gotten set on that, and so I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. Finally I came to an inn where they were sitting, talking about this mound dweller, and I learned where the mountain was. I got out there, turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. Right at that time, the princess was home alone, the mound man was somewhere else, wherever it was. \u201cJesus Christ, how did you get in here?\u201d she says. Yes, I\u2019d come here. \u201cOh, you\u2019re unlucky,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ll never get out of here alive,\u201d and then she showed me into the first room, there was a closet there with lots and lots of human skulls in it. Next I came into the second room, there was a closet with lots and lots of clothes, and finally I came into the third room where there were lots and lots of dead bodies lying about. Then I say to her, \u201cNow when he comes home, and you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, because he can\u2019t have it with him, since he can kill so many people.\u201d Yes, she\u2019d certainly do that. Then he\u2019ll probably say, \u201cThere is Christian blood in here, but you should answer him that he knows darn well that you are Christian.\u201d \u201cYes, you have to leave now,\u201d says the Princess to me and is so worried. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, because I want to hear how he answers you.\u201d Well, then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Then she asks him where his heart was. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it with you, since you can kill so many people.\u201d \u201cUgh, there is Christian blood in here,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, you know darn well that I\u2019m Christian,\u201d she says. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied with that, and he gets up, and they looked in all the rooms. But they didn\u2019t find anything, and he had to go back to bed. She asks him again where his heart was. \u201cMy heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and the egg is inside a duck, and that duck is inside a fox, and that is inside a dragon, and that dragon is at a manor farm. If they don\u2019t give it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom.\u201d When I\u2019d heard that, I climbed up out of the mountain again, and I went off to the manor farm. I go up to the manor lord and ask him if he didn\u2019t need a farmhand. Yes, he certainly needed a farmhand since there was a dragon that laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. He did that whenever the swine he was to have weren\u2019t fat enough. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t want to have that job.\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, it\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d I say, \u201cI can probably lay waste to him.\u201d OK, so I got the job. The first day I was to go out with the swine, and I was given seven fat swine to drive. Then I get to the dragon, \u201cGood day, Dragon,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you to have these fat swine?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve gotten each weekday.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s fight for them,\u201d I say, and then I turn myself into a lion and then I fight him. Finally he says, \u201cIf only I\u2019d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.\u201d And I said that if I\u2019d had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he\u2019d been crushed in a mill. Then he gave in, and I won the swine and came home to the manor lord with them. He was afraid of the dragon and was worried that he\u2019d destroy his land and kingdoms like he\u2019d threatened, but I was a fit young man and showed him the swine. It\u2019s good for him to go hungry a bit, I say. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen fat swine with me, because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. \u201cGood day, Dragon,\u201d I say. \u201cThank you,\u201d it says. \u201cDo you want these fat swine?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, I could certainly use them.\u201d\u2014\u201cSure, let\u2019s fight for them,\u201d and I turn myself into a lion and we fight for life and death over them. We have the same conversation and the manager stood there and listened to that. Finally, the dragon got tired of fighting with me, and then I went home with my swine. But the manor lord still couldn\u2019t settle down, and he wanted me to go off with twenty-one swine the next Monday. The manager was to come with me, and he was to bring a bite of bread and a dram to give me when I asked for it. We started fighting for the third time, and after we\u2019d fought for life and death for a while, the dragon says, \u201cIf only I\u2019d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.\u201d But I said: \u201cIf I had a bite of bread and a dram, then I\u2019d tear you into pieces so small it would be as if you'd been crushed in a mill.\u201d The manager immediately jumps in and stuffs it in me, and then I went to it again and got power over the dragon, so now I\u2019d won the twenty-one fat swine. I tore the dragon to pieces and killed him, and then a fox came out. I tore that one apart and killed it too, and then a duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. I tear it to pieces and kill it, and then an egg falls out, and it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got the egg in my shoulder sack and go back to the manor lord. He wanted to give me so much, since I\u2019d saved him from the dragon, but I wasn\u2019t too interested, and I set off to get back to the mountain. When I got there, he [the mound dweller] was lying on top of it and was so sick. \u201cOh dear God...,\u201d he says, \u201cis it you that has my heart?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\u2014\u201cOh, can\u2019t I have it back?\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, if you\u2019ll send the princess you have down there with you back to land, and just as nice and healthy as when you took her.\u201d Yes, he\u2019d certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Then she followed me home to her father\u2019s land, and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous. I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day after the wedding, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed on to me, and they flew with me to the third B\u00e6rmose (B\u00e6r swamp) and then I fell down. That\u2019s how I came here and could tell you this lie.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["afraid", "allow", "ants", "bags", "beautiful", "bed", "birds", "blood", "bread", "castle", "Christ", "Christian", "closet", "clothing", "danger", "darning", "daughter", "day", "dead bodies", "death", "dinner", "dog", "dragon", "dram", "dream", "duck", "egg", "fall", "farmhand", "fat", "father", "fight", "flock", "fox", "geese", "god", "happy", "heart", "herdsman", "home", "hungry", "hunter", "husband", "inn", "Jesus", "job", "kill", "king", "kingdom", "land", "learning", "lion", "manager", "manor farm", "manor lord", "meat", "Michael", "mill", "monday", "mound dweller", "mound man", "mountain", "night", "ocean", "power", "princess", "punishment", "road", "sea", "seven", "shooting", "shoulder", "sickness", "sinking", "skull", "slaughter", "stone", "swine", "table", "thank", "threat", "three", "tired", "tonight", "wandering", "wedding", "weekday", "window", "young"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Registrant over Evald Tang Kristensens Samling af Eventyr", "heading_english": "Index of Evald Tang Kristensen's collected Fairy Tales"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
