In most cases, the witch takes the shape of a hare (DS VII 106). The witch as fox is a bit unusual, but the fox's actions are not: here she attacks the animals on the farm and kills them. One of the strategies of combating a witch is to shoot her with a silver bullet, or something else made out of silver; buttons are commonly attested (DS VII 268). Ironically, the main character in the story, the man from T\u00f8rslev, is the local folk healer, and the witch's son is forced to ask him for the cure for his mother's ailment. Not surprisingly, given the damage the witch has done to the folk healer's farm, he demurs and the witch dies.\n\n     Hunting for foxes would have been a risky undertaking for most people, since the hunting rights to forests were reserved by the large land owners or the Crown. While the use of hunting blinds was common practice, it is not clear whether rotting animal carcasses were normally used as lures and blinds.\n\n     Jens Peter brings the account into his own immediate sphere, pointing out that he knew the son of the injured witch.", "danish_manuscript": "En mand i Torslev, Poul Knagholt, gav\nsig af med at kurere det der var forhegset.\nH. havde et Sl\u00e6b (et Aadsel, h. sl\u00e6bte\nfra et sted til et andet) og det vilde h.\nskyde R\u00e6ve i.
