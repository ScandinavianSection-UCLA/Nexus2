They had put their sealskins down by the shore and they were sunning themselves on the land. As soon as they saw him, they grabbed their skins and swam away, but one of them wasn\u2019t as quick as the others, so the fisherman took her skin. Now she had to follow him home and become his wife, and they had four children together. But one day when the fisherman wasn\u2019t home, the children found an old skin out by a shack and they showed this to their mother. As soon as she saw it, she ran down to the fjord, but she met her husband there. She asked him to be good to their children, and then she put the skin on and before the man could look around, she was way out in the water.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["children", "day", "fishing", "home", "husband", "land", "mermaid", "mother", "old", "shore", "skin", "swimming", "water", "wife"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Vandets \u00e5nder", "heading_english": "Water spirits"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
