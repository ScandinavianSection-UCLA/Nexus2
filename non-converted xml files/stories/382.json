The motif of the \"found cross\" (an intersection, crossed furrows, or other phenomena in the landscape that coincidentally make the shape of the cross) as effective against supernatural attack is a common feature of stories of encounters with supernatural outsiders, such as ghosts, witches and mound folk (see AMJ 2.20 and 3.08; KMP 1.19 and 1.61). \n\n     Although the young man escapes from his encounter with the ghost unscathed, the experience does change his behavior.", "danish_manuscript": "S. ver der ogsaa en M. h. gik en Aft s. sildig\n\n3774B\nsom Ungkarl paa en 17. 18 Aar og en hel\nDel modig var h.
