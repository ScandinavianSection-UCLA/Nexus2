Changelings were generally identified by unusually slow (or fast) development, and unusual physical features. Many of these physical and behavioral characteristics of the \"changeling\" may have had factual counterparts attributable to birth defects, genetic disorders, or other early childhood illnesses (M\u00f8ller 1940).\n\n     A changeling comes about when trolls steal a newborn human child and replace it with one of their own. This switch can only take place before the child is baptized. In some stories, the changeling is shown to be quite old. Frequently, the explicit motivation for the changing is the desire of the troll mother to have her child baptized, thus guaranteeing the troll child salvation (and depriving the human child of the same).\n\n     Sewing crosses, or otherwise using Christian iconography in the house, over or in the infant's bed, or on the infant's clothes were broadly considered efficacious against the threat of being switched. The loss of a child could have significant impact on a rural family, particularly if the child, because of its \"changed\" shape (e.g. deformity or mental deficiency) could not contribute to the economy of the farm. The danger was that the child, rather than assisting in domestic chores, small farming tasks, and later offering his parents a retirement (aft\u00e6gt) arrangement, would be a constant drain on the household economy. In the worst case, the changeling might force the family into the care of the parish poverty assistance administration.\n\n      The switch to narrative from shorter rhymes and descriptions of folk belief suggests that Peder had \"warmed up\" and was now ready to tell more stories. This session is more fractured than the earlier sessions with longer narratives interspersed with shorter descriptions, sayings, or rhymes.", "danish_manuscript": "I Vissing blev et Barn forbyt og de satte en\nSkifting i Steden og den satte \u00d8jene stive i\nHovedet hele Tiden, havde et us\u00e6dvanligt \u00f8je\nsyn.
