It follows directly on his stories and his own experiences of portentous dreams. In this variant, the wanderings of the mouse reveal the location of a buried treasure. Interestingly, and unlike many other stories of buried treasure, the farmhand who digs for the treasure is successful in his quest. Success in the treasure hunt may be related to earlier versions of this story that were known in Scandinavia (Chesnutt 1991).\n\n    The story is first attested in the writings of Paul the Deacon [Paulus Diaconus] from the eighth century. In his writings, he recounts the story of Guntram, the Frankish king of Burgundy and Orl\u00e9ans, (b.525-d.592). Variants of this story are accordingly referred to as the \"Guntram legend\" (Chesnutt 1991). In the Guntram legend, the king leaves his body as a snake, and his squire helps him cross a small stream by laying down his sword. The snake slithers into a hole and when the king awakens, he says he has dreamed of a magnificent treasure. When the hill is excavated, they discover a remarkable treasure--somewhat surprising given the snake's eye view that otherwise distorts the environment. Helinand of Froidmont (b.1160-d.1229) relates another variant of the story in his Chronicon (1211-1223), without the discovery of treasure. The animal in that story is a small white weasel-like creature.\n\n     Jens's variant maintains the motif of the companion's assistance in crossing the stream, and the discovery of the treasure. The soul takes the form of the tradition dominant mouse, and the treasure is sufficiently modest in keeping with the questions of perspective and scale attributed to the mouse (DS II G 102).\n\n     Christiansen notes that the story is widely attested, including a variant from Japan (Christiansen 1992, 47). In some Danish variants, the mouse returns and the farmhand is able to tell the news from home (DS II G 107), a phenomenon reminiscent of stories of Odin and his two ravens who keep him apprised of happenings in the world. In another variant, the farmhand's companion prevents the mouse from returning into the body of the sleeping farmhand, resulting in his death (DS II G 106).", "danish_manuscript": "To Karle i Heden at grav T\u00f8rv. 1 i S\u00f8vn\nhvid Mus ud af Halsen og hen til en Rende\nog l\u00f8b og sn\u00f8lrede.
