The manor lord is threatening not only in life, but in death as well. \n\n     Jens Peter turns to the wise minister for help, narratively proposing this as an effective strategy against the haunting of the manor lord (Tangherlini 1998). The conjuring does not proceed smoothly, and the farmhand's interruption nearly dooms the minister, a motif that is wll known from other stories of conjuring (DS V 728 and 733; PJ 2.05; KMP 1.07). In some stories, the minister actually does lose power over the ghost because of the farmhand's interruption, and these stories often detail the catastrophic results of that interruption (DS IV 744).\n\n     Kristian IV's wife, Kristine Munk, was exiled to the manor farm at Boller, and lived there from 1630-1658. Later, the manor farm became part of the larger holdings of the Count of Frijesenborg (PJ 3.18).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Herremand her paa Boller \ni Taars det var en stor Kj\u00e6ltring og\ns. slem til at plage hans B\u00f8nder med\nHoveri og Skatter og Tiender og jog dem\nfra deres gaarde og turede med dem.
