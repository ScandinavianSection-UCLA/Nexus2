It also resonates with folktales in which husbands are duped by their wives and lovers (see ATU 1355, \"The Man Hidden under the Bed\").\n\n    As with BJK 1.22, Tang Kristensen based his main published version on a concatenation of collected variants, noting, \"Alle de af mig indsamlede 12 opskrifter af visen (eller brudstykker deraf) har jeg sammenarbejdet til f\u00f8lgende opskrift\" [I have combined the twelve recordings of this ballad (or fragments of it) that I have collected into the following recording] (Kristensen DSk, 154). Fortunately, Tang Kristensen also included Jens's version in unedited form. There is a significant difference in length between Jens's version and the concatenated version presented at the end of this annotation. Tang Kristensen did not delete the obscene reference from the published version but did offer an alternate ending that substitutes crafts for the three children--mirroring the three crafts in the tale--rather than criminal behavior and execution. Jens, in his variant, ends his song with the miller's wife sinking into the mill stream. \n\n     The concatenated version reads as follows:\n\nThe cobbler and tailor hatched a plan,\nthey wanted to go to the miller\u2019s daughter\n\nThe cobbler stuffed the tailor into a sack\nand carried him off to the mill stream\n\nThe cobbler carried the tailor to the mill dam,\nand there stood the miller damming the water\n\nAnd when he came to the mill bridge,\nthere stood the miller in his silver buckled shoes\n\n\u201cAnd listen miller, both fair and fine,\ncan you mill my grain without charging me?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, dear farmer, what is in your sack,\nthat you want to forbid me my fee?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn top is barley, and on the bottom is wheat,\nand the little mice really want to eat that.\n\nIn the sack there is both barley and wheat,\nand where can I put it, where it will be safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll store your mill sack\nso it will be protected from rats and mice.\n\nPut it up in my mill loft\ntomorrow I will mill it as fine as dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t put my bag in your loft,\nbecause rats and mice could eat it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then put it by our daughter\u2019s bed,\nthere aren\u2019t any mice running there.\u201d\n\nLate at night, when the dew it fell,\nthe sack began to crawl and walk.\n\n\u201cAnd listen, dear father, light a candle,\nI think there are thieves in our house.\u201d\n\nThen he patted her on her snowwhite cheek\n\u201cBe quiet, it is your beloved.\u201d\n\nShe shouted: \u201cDear father, blow out the candle,\nit was only a cat that caught a mouse.\u201d\n\nThe old hag woke up in the corner:\n\u201cI think the cat has boots on.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, you hag, in the corner you lay,\ntomorrow you\u2019re going out into the mill stream.\n\nShut up you hag, or you\u2019ll be shamed,\ntomorrow your going into the mill pond.\u201d\n\nEarly in the morning that tailor he got up,\nhe tossed the hag into the mill pond\u2019s high water\n\nYes, the miller he stood on the driest land,\nthe hag lay out in the water and sang.\n\nThe hag sank, and the sack floated,\nand all of her flour turned into porridge.\n\nYes, it wasn\u2019t strange that the hag was heavy,\nsince her cunt and ass weighed a hundred pounds.\n\nThe miller with his thick waist\nwas afraid he was going to lose his life.\n\nThe miller he had such a crooked tooth\nhe hooked that into the hag and pulled her to land.\n\nThat\u2019s what our daughter got for the mouse\u2019s walk,\nshe got two cradles by her bed.\n\nThere stood cradles by her bed,\nthe one was a girl and the other a boy.\n\nAnd they grew up, and got so big,\nthe one became a thief and the other became a whore.\n\nThe one was hanged, and the other was burned\n-Tyrilus out in l\u00f6ndum\nand there my ballad has an end.\n-Since tonight we were so merry.\n\nAnother ending is not so bad and a bit more innocent:\n\nIt went on for five months\nOur miller\u2019s daughter became uncomfortable\n\nYes, it went on for nine months,\nshe gave birth to two sons, had one more, and it was three\n\nThey stayed there for eighteen years,\nYou better believe they were happy in the miller\u2019s farm\n\nThe one became a cobbler, the other became a smith,\nit went so bad, they had one who became a tailor", "danish_manuscript": "Skr\u00e6dderen og Skomageren [de] makkede et Raad\nom hvem af dem M\u00f8llerens Datter kunde faa.\n--\nSkr. nu putt.
