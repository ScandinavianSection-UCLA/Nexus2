Exceptional personal gain was, in a limited good model, seen as coming at the expense of others (Foster 1959). Making a pact with the devil would guarantee wealth, but it would also underscore one's willingness to transgress the boundaries of the human community for personal gain. \n\n     Not surprisingly, the main character in stories about pacts with the devil often come from the wealthy classes: merchants and large land owners. The stories may act as a form of narrative revenge, chipping away at the power and prestige of the wealthy by telling stories of their unholy alliances. The resolution of these stories usually consists of the main human character's grisly death, a fitting punishment for eschewing god and, by extension, the community. \n\n     Peder's story includes an interesting interlude in which Lavst tricks the devil. In many variants, the person who tricks the devil is a wise minister. Leaving something undone--in this case, his stockings--is a common ruse. Other tricks include asking to wait until a candle burns down, and then extinguishing it (DS VI 95), or asking to be allowed to put on one's clothes, and then leaving a button undone (DS VI 87). The ruse, however, only lasts so long, and Lavst eventually has to make good on his side of the bargain. \n\n     The merchant class was conservative. In the st\u00e6nderforsamling (local assemblies) and later in the Rigsdag (parliament), the merchants from the market towns generally supported the policies of the urban mercantilists, the civil servants and the large land owners. This political stance was in direct opposition to that of the rural farming and cotter class. It is not surprising, then, that Peder would tell a story in which a stalwart of the merchant class turns out to be in league with the devil.\n\n     Peder's story of a pact with the devil is somewhat unusual in the precise attention to detail in his description of Satan. In many stories, Satan is personified (as he is in the Bible) (Valk 2001). The description of a thin-faced man in black with a long cape, with a long mustache and pointy beard is in line with other descriptions of Satan. In other legends, he is also described as having horns and cloven feet (DS VI 471; DS VI 478).\n\n      The description of Satan's carriage is also typical. A lone traveler in a carriage pulled by two black horses suggests significant wealth. The glowing wheels are at once ominous and suggestive of extraordinary speed. The speed of the devil's travel is confirmed by the short time it takes him to reach Skanderborg, meet with Lavst Thomsen and return.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en M. i Skanderb. L.
