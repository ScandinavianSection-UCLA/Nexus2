The man's apparent pact with the devil, despite his poverty, guarantees that Satan will arrive in some form or other; here he takes on the characteristic dog form (Woods 1959). Ironically, it is one of the witch masters whom Jens Yvsten (normalized in the published version to Justesen) rails against that cures him of his apparent Satanic affliction. In the published version, Tang Kristensen eliminated the opening line of the manuscript  that sets up this juxtaposition.\n\n     Stopping the clock as part of the cure is related to stories of tricking the devil. Here, the devil is supposed to come and get the man on the stroke of a specific time--by stopping the clock, the devil is tricked out of his due, and the man can be cured. Jens suggests that the man's subsequent demeanor, particularly that he stops swearing, is strange, implying that swearing was par for the course among farmers and rural workers.\n\n     In his coda, Jens adds some local historical detail about the razing of Skjelhusene (Boundary Houses) that does not appear in the published version. Skjelhusene are shown on early maps several hundred meters to the east of Mylenbj\u00e6rg, next to the forest ranger's house.
