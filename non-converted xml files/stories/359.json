Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, in his study of the tale, identifies three subtypes (1958). The destruction of the church at night may be linked to the mound dwellers. Other typical church destroyers are trolls and giants. The use of oxen to find the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contradistinction to the communal elements of the church. Also, allowing oxen to roam free and, in other variants, at night, runs counter to normal roles for domesticated animals: their grazing is usually limited and they are not used productively at night. Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter also told a variant of the legend (KMP 1.18).", "danish_manuscript": "Todbj\u00e6rg Kirke skulde have ligget paa Kraj-\nbj\u00e6rg Mark.
