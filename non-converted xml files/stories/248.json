The tailor's challenge to the gypsies--asking where they are from--has an implicit legal component. If they were not from the local area (and the tailor most likely knew this), then they were not allowed to ask for alms in the community. Their reaction is amusing, and allows Kirsten Marie to swear numerous oaths without any of the approbation that would otherwise follow using such colorful language. The housewife comes across as the strongest figure in the story, using her mangle roller to chase off the potentially threatening--and clearly dishonest--outsiders.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Skr\u00e6dder i Voldum en G. h. var\ni en grd henne i Alstrup at sy.
