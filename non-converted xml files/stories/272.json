The grandfather believes that the cunning man has predicted his wife's death, and there is considerable narrative tension that builds up as he returns home. The tension is relieved by his wife's humorous outburst that also serves as a confirmation of the abilities of at least this particular cunning man. Her great grandfather must be skeptical of the abilities of cunning folk, and therefore is unable to understand her seemingly miraculous cure.\n\n     Kirsten Marie told another version of this tale as the first story in her second session with Tang Kristensen (KMP 2.01).
