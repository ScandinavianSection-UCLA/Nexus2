His account offers a small window into the otherwise hidden world of the itinerant population of natmandsfolk (refuse collectors; nightmen).\n\n      The distinction that Kirsten Marie draws between the rakker (knacker) and the gjelder (gelder) is a subtle one. Christian II's law for towns required that every market town should have a knacker (rakker) and an executioner (b\u00f8ddel). Over the years, the distinction between the executioner and the knacker became more distinct, with the executioner only having responsibility for executions and the knacker having a broader series of responsibilities, including the burial of suicides and the hung, flaying of animals that died (instead of being slaughtered), cleaning sewers and the like. \n\n      Subsequently, the term rakker (knacker) became a common appellation in the eastern and southern parts of Vendsyssel (northern Jutland) for people engaged in all the jobs considered \"dirty,\" such as flaying, chimney sweeping and the gelding of animals (Gaardboe 1968, 18). In northern Vendsyssel, the common appelation was \"natfolk\" or \"natmandsfolk,\" because the jobs they did were ostensibly carried out at night under the cover of darkness, or were otherwise hidden from view: the cleaning of latrines, the burial of suicides, and the like. \n\n      Both the knacker and the gelder were members of the lowest social class, albeit above the class of unemployed or unemployable poor. They were often buried in the least desirable part of the cemetery, namely the northern end.\n\n     The various laws concerning begging and poverty assistance did little for this class of itinerant workers. At the same time, they ignored laws concerning commerce that would bar them from selling knick-knacks or working as craftsmen at the farms they visited. \n\n     Natmandsfolk were ethnically Danish, in contrast to other itinerant groups, referred to as tatere (gypsies), a term used for foreign wanderers irrespective of their heritage, or glarmesterfolk (glaziers), who were often not of Danish heritage (Gaarboe 1968, 12-13). \n\n     A significant amount of scholarship has focused on the life and hard times of the various itinerant populations in Denmark in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Perhaps one of the best known and earliest of these studies was Me\u00efr Goldschmidt's study of wanderers and outsiders in Denmark (1867). Dyrlund's study of gypsies and other itinerants is considered to be the first significant historical study of this phenomenon (1872). Earlier, Sundt undertook a similar study in Norway (1850). While a small number of these people were gypsies, the vast majority were ethnic Danes who for various reasons had dropped out of society and had become vagabonds.", "danish_manuscript": "I Hvall\u00f8s boede en Rakker og en Gjaller.\nRakkeren [var] og hans Kone og havde ingen B\u00f8rn\nmen Gjalleren havde to, en Datter og en S\u00f8n.\nS. var der en Karl der tjente der i Byen.\nh. tjente hans Faster.
