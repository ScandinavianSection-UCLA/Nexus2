Reforms in the school system up through the 1860s led to significantly better teacher training and the abolition of harsh corporal punishment. Discipline was often a problem at the schools, yet the measures taken by Niels Ring would be considered extreme at any time (see N\u00f8rr 1994). The amusing episode with the cheese rind relies on a fairly elaborate play on words for its humor: \"at have en skalk i nakken\" is an expression meaning to be cunning. \"At f\u00e5 en skalk i halsen\" substitutes \"at f\u00e5\" for \"at have\" and \"halsen\" (throat) for \"nakken\" (neck) and, while it literally means \"to have a rind caught in one's throat\", it is close enough to the expression for \"cunning\" that it sets up a humorous cognitive dissonance, since someone choking on a cheese rind can hardly be characterized cunning.", "danish_manuscript": "Degnen i Svejstrup Niels Ring, h. var s haard\nte naar h en Gang straffede en T\u00f8s [saa] for-\nkede Kl\u00e6derne op om hende og satte hende\nop med den bare Ende paa den gloende\nKakkelovn en Tid s.

One of them was called Mads, he'd been born up at his great grandmother's house. So one day he'd gotten off to a bit of a late start, and when he got to school, he wasn't even finished with his breakfast, since he arrived chewing on a cheese rind and a piece of bread.
