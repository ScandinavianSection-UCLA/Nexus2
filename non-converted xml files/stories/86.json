In the previous story, he rode on his friend, spewing obscenities, while in this story he is so drunk he does not realize that his wife is along in the wagon. \n\n     Alcoholism was a significant problem in rural Denmark. Attempts to start a temperance society were already underway in 1841. In 1879, the first of these societies came into being, closely related to the work of evangelical movements. Although the drunk man's antics are amusing, there is also a certain tension informing the story, as his drunkenness threatens to upset the fragile household economy.", "danish_manuscript": "S\u00f8ren \u00d8stergaard var en Gang til Nibe Marked\nog havde faaet et L\u00e6s Sild paa hjem og havde\nkj\u00f8bt noget Karmon der nede, Fade og saadant.\nS. var h. ogsaa bleven fuld og s. v\u00e6ltede han\nder var ikke heller saadan Veje som nu.
