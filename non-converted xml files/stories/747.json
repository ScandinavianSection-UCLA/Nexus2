Da gik hun vild, og s\u00e5 kom hun til en sten med r\u00f8de bogstaver p\u00e5, men hun kunde ikke l\u00e6se dem. Hun gik hendes vej og fandt ikke stenen siden. S\u00e5 paste min morbroder Jens Mikkelsen f\u00e5r p\u00e5 den samme mark. En dag finder han et hul ned i jorden, og da han nu r\u00e6kker hans kj\u00e6p ned, s\u00e5 er der noget, der klingrer, ligesom det kunde v\u00e6re s\u00f8lvpenge. Nu vilde han jo have det unders\u00f6gt, men s\u00e5 vilde han f\u00f8rst se efter, om f\u00e5rene ikke gik til skade, og da han s\u00e5, at de tr\u00e6ngte til at blive m\u00f6dt, s\u00e5 lod han kj\u00e6ppen st\u00e5 i hullet, og hans tr\u00e6sko ved siden af. Da han nu kom tilbage, var ingen af delene at finde. Den jord, hvorp\u00e5 det skete, kaldes Korsbakken. P\u00e5 den samme mark l\u00e5 en flad sten, der var omtrent 5 kvarter p\u00e5 hver m\u00e5de, og der var vel et par tommer muld over den. A kunde lige skrufle over den med ploven. A s\u00e5 egentlig ikke p\u00e5 den, men det var let at se, hvor det var, for om sommeren, n\u00e5r den indt\u00e6gt l\u00e5 i gr\u00e6smark, gik gr\u00e6sset p\u00e5 den ud. Endelig kom a til at t\u00e6nke mig om, det var vel den gang, a h\u00f8rte mere snak om skatten, og s\u00e5 vilde a til at have stenen unders\u00f6gt, men da kunde vi ikke finde den. Den var alts\u00e5 sut ned. A har endda siden gravet efter den og har aldrig fundet den.

Then she got lost, and then she came to a stone with red letters on it, but she couldn\u2019t read them. Then my mother\u2019s brother Jens Mikkelsen was watching sheep on the same field. One day he finds a hole down into the ground, and when he stretches his staff down into the hole, there is something that jingles, just like it could be silver coins. So now he wants to check it out, but first he wanted to make sure that the sheep didn\u2019t wander into harm, and when he saw that he\u2019d have to go out and get them, he left his staff in the hole, and his clogs next to it. When he got back, he couldn\u2019t find any of his things. The ground where this happened is called Korsbakken. In the same field there was a flat stone, which was about thirty inches on each side, and there was a couple of inches of sod on top of it. I could just scrape over it with the plow. I never looked at it, but it was easy to see where it was, because during the summer when everything was covered with grass, the grass on it died. Finally I came to think about that, at that time I'd heard a lot of talk about a treasure, and so I wanted to check the stone out, but then we couldn\u2019t find it. It had sunk down. I\u2019ve dug for it later but I\u2019ve never been able to find it. It\u2019ll probably come to light at some point, but it's possible that the person who is supposed to find it hasn\u2019t been born yet.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["birth", "brother", "clogs", "coins", "day", "death", "digging", "field", "grass", "harm", "Jens Mikkelsen", "letter", "mother", "plow", "red", "sheep", "silver", "sinking", "stone", "summer", "treasure", "wandering", "weather"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Sagn om skatte", "heading_english": "Legends about treasure"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
