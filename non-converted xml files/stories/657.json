When he got there, Jens Plovg\u00e5rd wasn't home but his wife thought that he would come home that evening so he could wait, and she suggested that he go and lay down out in the barn. He goes out there too. During the night, Jens Plovg\u00e5rd comes home, and his wife told him about this man from Ty who had been there. But she doesn't tell him that he is out in the barn. So Jens Plovg\u00e5rd goes out to the barn too, and calls the devil to him and asks him where the pigs had gotten off to. The Evil One tells him that the man's neighbor had killed them and buried them in a sand dune he had near the farm. The man from Ty lies there listening to this and then he thinks that he could just as well go home. But he didn't get all the way home, since Jens Plovg\u00e5rd had sent someone after him, and he had to go back and get the proper message from him.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["barn", "burial", "devil", "dune", "evening", "evil", "farm", "grazing", "home", "Jens Plovg\u00e5rd", "kill", "message", "neighbor", "night", "pig", "sand", "sea", "store", "west", "wife", "witch"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Kloge m\u00e6nd og koner og deres bedrifter", "heading_english": "Cunning men and women and their activities"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
