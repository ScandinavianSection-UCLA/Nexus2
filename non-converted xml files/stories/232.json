They were quartered throughout Denmark, including Kolding, where they accidentally burned down the Koldinghus castle. While most Danes were anxious about the arrival of these troops, given their bad experiences with the Polish troops in the late seventeenth century, the Spanish troops turned out to be much better guests. The troops were eventually evacuated by the British, once they discovered that their fellow Spaniards were engaged in a guerrilla war against Napoleon's rule in Spain.", "danish_manuscript": "Der laa en Gaard ude i Halling Skov der kald-\ntes Jungstrup.
