Peas were often blended into bread dough to compensate for a lack of rye. \n\n     Given his presumed age, her grandmother's father's reference to \"enemies\" must hearken back to even before the Napoleonic wars, and the stationing of Spaniards and Frenchmen in Denmark (1808) or possibly the British invasion (1807, which was centered on Sj\u00e6lland). Problematically, there were not any foreign troops stationed in Denmark during the mid to late eighteenth century. Kirsten Marie told other stories of Spanish soldiers in Denmark (KMP 1.13), but these troops were not enemies. They had been sent to assist Denmark in a planned attack on Sweden. There are no other occupations of Denmark that would correspond to her great grandmother's father's experiences. Another possibility is that the story is related to her own experiences either during the Three Years' War (1848-50) or the War of 1864. The soldiers could be German troops who were stationed throughout Jutland in 1848, or Prussian soldiers who occupied large parts of Jutland in 1864, nearly twenty years later.\n\n     In the published version, Tang Kristensen corrected all the references to bread to \"pea bread,\" rather than the somewhat confusing references to ale-bread, a porridge made by soaking bread in ale.", "danish_manuscript": "De brugte \u00c6rtebr\u00f8d og det var stramt\nNaar der om Morgen blev kaldt til\nDavre og D\u00f8ren blev lukket op kunde\nde lugte \u00d8llebr\u00f8det ud i Laden.\nDa Fjenderne var her inde fortalte\nmin Bedstemoer fra hendes Fader\naf, te de vilde v\u00e6re glad ved at ligge paa Stald-\nm\u00f8ddingen og \u00e6de deres [\u00c6] \u00c5\u00e5lbr\u00f8d\nde kunde ikke v\u00e6re ude for Fjenderne.\nHer kunde de ingen Rug avle for her\nvar Lermarker, de skulde hen paa \nSandmarken ved Torsager efter det.\n", "english_manuscript": "They used to use pea bread, and that was rank.
