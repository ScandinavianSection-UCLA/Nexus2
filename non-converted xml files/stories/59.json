In other variants, it is a hired girl (DS VII 436) or a farmhand (DS VII 435). The witch's formula is a key element in the story, and numerous variants of the formula exist. The unwitting rider always makes an amusing substitution in directional adverbs. Jens adds the substitution of the unlikely destination of Hasseris, a town just west of Aalborg. These stories often have a humorous, rather than tragic, ending.", "danish_manuscript": "Saadan Folk har der v\u00e6ret her paa Egnen.\nHer henne i de n\u00f8rre Byer var en Kj\u00e6ll. h. \nsmurte hendes Ovnrafte og hu havde pyntet\nen Tagkj\u00e6rn ud og lagt ved Siden af M. s. l\u00e6nge\nog s. laa der en Stakelsm. der ude i deres\nBrygg. et Steder og h. h\u00f8rte det hvad hu sagde\ntil Ovnsraften. ogsaa en Sct.
