The evil ox is likely the devil in animal form (Woods 1959). The disruption of the farm is unmistakable in this story: the animals are in peril, and workers refuse to stay at the farm. The farmer himself offers a strategy that successfully drives the ox from the farm, and helps restore balance. The ox's fart lingers but causes no further damage.\n\n     Magical harnesses are widely attested, largely in connection with witches and their ride to the sabbath (DS VII 443). In some stories, the cunning person attaches a magical harness to the haunt and leads it out to be conjured (PJ 2.02).\n\n     Binding the ox with an elaborately crafted magical harness is reminiscent of the binding of the Fenris wolf in Snorri's Edda. In that story, the suspicious Fenrir is fettered with the magical harness Gleipnir crafted by dwarves out of the sound of a cat's step, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish and the spit of a bird (Faulkes 1995, 28). Given this and other obscure references to Scandinavian mythology in Jens Peter's repertoire, it might well be that he was familiar with the mythological stories that had been widely propagated during the nineteenth century.", "danish_manuscript": "En Mand paa Linderumsgaard der var f\u00f8rend\nKapitain Skj\u00e6rul, h. kunde aldrig have nogen\n\n7812B\nStuder\u00f8gter, for der gik jo en grum stor sort\nStud i Studehuset.
