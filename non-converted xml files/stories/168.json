In many variants, the girl does not realize that the man is dead until they arrive at the cemetery (DS II G 221). In Jens Peter's variant, the girl is terrified by the black dog digging in the cemetery, and she soon realizes that she is dealing with a horrifying revenant. It is somewhat surprising that she does not realize that she is dealing with a revenant already at the beginning of the story when her boyfriend rides up, since she should know that he is dead.\n\n     Jens Peter continues his story beyond the standard resolution in which the girl recognizes that her fianc\u00e9 is dead and runs for safety (DS II G 219). In his variant, the revenant appears at the door of the church house and attempts to enlist another dead person in capturing the girl. The girl's shredded apron on the grave stone is reminiscent of the shredded apron strings that reveal the true identity of a werewolf (BJK 2.15).\n\n     The rhyme that the boy recites is a common feature of the story, although the order of the first and second line is sometimes switched. The greatest variation is in the third line:  \"r\u00e6ddes du ikke lille Pige\" [aren't you getting scared, little girl] (DS II G 221); \"bliver du ikke bange min lille Pige\" [aren't you getting frightened my little girl] (DS II G 220); \"frygter du ej, mit hj\u00e6rte\" [do you not fear, my heart] (DS II G 220); \"er du ikke bange lille Lisbet\" [aren't you frightened, little Lisbet] (DSnr II G 136); \"er du bange mit Hj\u00e6rte\" [are you frightened, my heart] (DSnr II G 139); \"bliver du ikke bange, lille Pige\" [are you getting frightened, little girl] (DS II G 140); \"er du ikke bange, lille Pige\" [aren't you frightened, little giril] (DSnr II G 141); \"\u00c6 do et r\u00e6j, Karen?\" [Ain't you scared, Karen?] (DSnr II G 142); \"\u00e6 do et r\u00e6d, lille Maren\" [ain't you scared, little Maren] (DS II G 222 and DSnr II G 143); \"og kj\u00e6resten min s\u00f8rger ikke\" [and my sweetheart does not sorrow] (DSnr II G 145). Grundtvig in Gamle danske Minder  III (241-2) asked his readers to send him examples of the story in which the verse appeared, noting that, as of 1861, there were no Danish recordings of the legend.\n\n     Tang Kristensen added a long note to the end of the published version of this story, writing: \"Ved enligt liggende Kirker laa der tit et Kirkehus, hvor man s\u00f8gte til med smaa B\u00f8rn, der skulde d\u00f8bes o. lign. Af og til kunde der sidde et Fattiglem til Leje der. Ved Vindum Kirke har der f. Ex. i \u00e6ldre Tid v\u00e6ret saadant et Kirkehus, der for l\u00e6ngst er revet ned og ikke erstattet med noget andet. Fort\u00e6lleren sagde, at Kisten blev vendt, men var det ikke Liget, der blev vendt i Kisten, saa han kom til at ligge paa Maven?\" [Near solitary churches there was often a church house where one brought small children that were to be baptized and the like. Every now and then a poor person could be there as a renter. At Vindum church, for example, in olden times there was a church house like that which has long since been torn down and nothing has been built in its place. The storyteller said that the coffin was turned, but isn't it more likely that it was the corpse in the coffin that was turned so it wound up lying on its stomach?] There is no reason to think that Jens Peter did not mean that the coffin should be turned, rather than the body. The general belief was that bodies should be carried out of the house feet first, otherwise they could return to the house to haunt. Apparently, the body has been left in the house with the head facing the door, making it possible for him to assist the boy's revenant in capturing the girl. Turning the coffin around would deny him that ability.", "danish_manuscript": "En Karl og en Pige havde svoret hinanden\nKj\u00e6rlighed i Liv og D\u00f8d. S. d\u00f8er Karlen\nog bliver begravet.

Then she was to hold his horse for a little while. She felt that he was gone for quite a while and she wanted to go and look through the cemetery gate.

Soon after there's a knock on the door, and it names the name of the man who is lying in the coffin, he was to open the door. But then the corpse answered that he was forbidden to do so, he'd been turned and so he couldn't open the door.
