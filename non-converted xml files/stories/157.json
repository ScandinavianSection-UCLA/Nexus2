In this case, the Bragholdt hag gets her ability to show again from a small demon, a confirmation of her link to Satan. This link is implicit in her owning Cyprianus in the previous story (JPP 2.06). The Bragholdt hag's morality is drawn further into question when she is described as a drunk. One of the ongoing concerns in debates over the different classes of poor--the deserving and undeserving--was the high incidence of alcoholism among the poor, and the effects of alcoholism on their ability to provide for themselves.\n\n     Stories of questionable practices in the cunning woman's barn are fairly widely attested--enough for Tang Kristensen to include a subsection in his published collection Danske sagn entitled \"I den kloge kones lade om natten\" [In the cunning woman's barn at night] (DS VI, 323 and 326). In these stories, the cunning woman calls the devil to her to extract information (DS VI 898). The story, however, is not solely a criticism of the Bragholdt hag. The local economies of rural Denmark were moving quickly towards complete monetization by the last decades of the nineteenth century, and payment for services rather than barter arrangements had become the norm. In the story, Iver attempts to sidestep paying the Bragholdt hag for rendering a valuable service--canvas was important both as an item that could be sold and as a source of material for work clothes--only to discover that the implicit contractual arrangement held sway. She of course uses her supernatural power, rather than the power of the magistrate, to collect on her debt. But she also makes good on her side of the bargain, and the new economic order is firmly established: monetary payment for services rendered. In some variants, the person manages to get away without paying (DS VI 900), while others include a greater emphasis on the contractual arrangement than in this variant (DS VI 899).\n\n     That the canvas is hidden in the minister's meadow is a tantalizing variation on the story. In his repertoire, Jens Peter tells several stories of ministers who tread the fine line between good and evil. The implication in this story is that either (a) the minister--or perhaps his wife--had something to do with the theft or (b) someone is trying to frame the minister for the crime.     \n\n     Unlike Peder Johansen, who's father's foster father was a cunning man, and Ane Margrete Jensdatter (AMJ 2.20), whose stories generally endorse the powers of cunning folk, Jens Peter is critical of cunning folk. Here, he links the Bragholdt hag directly to the devil, and implies that she is in fact a witch. Her actions align her with another cunning person in his repertoire, St\u00f8v-Karen, who is interested primarily in personal gain (JPP 1.04). Jens Peter's critique of the cunning folk diverges from the critique proffered by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, who was much more of a rationalist and viewed the widespread belief in the ability of  witches and cunning folk to be foolish.\n\n     The distance from Knudsholm to Bragholdt is approximately fifteen kilometers.     \n", "danish_manuscript": "Der boede en Mand paa Knudsholmen\ni Ugilt Sogn, de kaldte ham Iver Hol\nmen eller den lange Iver, h. havde\net stort Stykke L\u00e6rred, der blev v\u00e6k\net Efteraar.
