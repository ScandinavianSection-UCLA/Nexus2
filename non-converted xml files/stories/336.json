The story also provides commentary on popular attitudes toward ministers. The minister assumes an overly paternalistic tone toward the seemingly simple Maren, who lets loose with her off-color verse at the very end of an otherwise solemn funeral.\n\n     The manuscript starts out with little dialect notation and then, after a false start, possibly on Tang Kristensen's side, switches to a dialect heavy recording. The obscene reference in the ending verse is covered by the use of an abbreviated dialect word in the published version, py.., an abbreviation for pyk, a dialect term for penis. The entire word is missing in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen having recorded only ellipses, his standard notation for words he considered obscene.\n\n     This story is also cataloged as \u00c6v 1461.", "danish_manuscript": "Per og Maren var et Par \u00c6gtefolk.
