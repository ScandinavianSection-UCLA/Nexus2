In Jens' variant, the man is given bread--here described as flatbread, a treat usually given to children--and beer in return for repairing the peel-board. The beer is an unusual element, since the payment in variants of this story usually relates to the repaired baking implement. The man's invocation of Christian symbolism is understandable, yet it undermines the tit-for-tat nature of the barter arrangement--and the mound dweller points this transgression out to the man. Jens does not include any information on the outcome of eating the mound dweller's food, although presumably the outcome was not noteworthy (neither remarkably good nor remarkably bad). Instead, Jens focuses on the similarity and compatibility between the human world and the world of the mound dwellers.\n\nThe plow beam is the part of the plow that connects the plow handle to the plow share.", "danish_manuscript": "Der kom en G. en Bj\u00e6rgmandskone sprin-\ngende med hendes dejede H\u00e6nder ud af\nBavnh\u00f8j og smed Skaade, i Stykker.\nEn Mand der pl\u00f8vede der gjorde den\ni Stand.
