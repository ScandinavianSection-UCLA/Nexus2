Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck in his study of the tale identifies three subtypes (1958). The destruction of the church at night may be linked to the mound dwellers. Other typical church destroyers are trolls and giants. The use of oxen to determine the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contrast to the communal elements of the church. Also, allowing oxen to roam free and, in other variants, at night, runs counter to normal roles for domesticated animals: their grazing is usually limited to specific fields and they are not used productively at night. \n\n     In some variants, such as this one, the oxen are forced to pull some of the building materials for the church, whereas in other variants, the animals are simply hitched together (DS III 898). Kirsten Marie tells another version of this story in a later session (KMP 3.10). Ane Margrete Jensdatter also told a variant of this story (AMJ 3.05).", "danish_manuscript": "Ruu Kirke skulde f\u00f8rst have lagt imeld [Al]\nStah\u00e5t og Rude Kirke op\u00e5 Br\u00e5dagrene og\nligesom de byggede op om Dagen blev det\nrevet ned om Natten.
