In those stories, trees or rose bushes grow out of the graves and intertwine. In this case, as in AT 836D tales, \"Fighting after Death\", two contentious men continue to fight even after their death. \n\n      Carrying the small box of the fighting fists around the church during the  New Years' celebration is strange. Although the fighting fists might offer a strong corrective to members of the parish who were involved in petty squabbles--and thus help to unite the community at the start of the new year--the display is carnivalesque in nature and unfitting for the solemn atmosphere of the church. The church seems an unlikely place to parade a phenomenon that is clearly linked to haunting and, by extension, Satan. Interestingly, Tang Kristensen deletes the reference to this taking place in the church in the published version of the story.
