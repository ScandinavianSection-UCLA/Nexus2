Other animals, such as calves (DS V 39 and 49), oxen (DS V 45) and horses (DS V 37) are widely attested as similar haunts. In some variants, the connection between the animal haunt and the devil is made explicit (DS V 47).\n\n     Animal haunts are often inexplicable, yet they disrupt, to one degree or another, the farm, particularly the barn. The barn is doubly at risk in Jens Peter's story, since the two holes cannot be repaired. The sow's subsequent disappearance in the stone wall may be linked to conjuring, as stone walls, mill dams, and other boundary markers are frequently mentioned as places where spirits have been conjured (DS V 359 and DS V 713). In this case, the conjuring must have been unsuccessful, since the haunt continues to disrupt the farm.\n\n     Jens Peter's stories tended to be quite localized to the area near where he lived. Amdal is one kilometer west of Ilbjerge huse. Hvidstedg\u00e5rd is on the south side and one and a half kilometers down the road from Amdal to T\u00e5rs, four kilometers to the southwest.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var et lille Hus i det vestreste af\nTaars paa s\u00f8ndre Side af Amdal.
