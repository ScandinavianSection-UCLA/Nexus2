The next night he was supposed to go out to him again, but his wife and children wouldn\u2019t let him go. Then there was such a row that they thought that the barn had tipped over, so the man had to go out. The next day, he went over to minister Bang in Vilstrup in Skibet parish and asked him to help him get rid of the Evil One\u2019s company. Then the minister taught him a verse that he was to read for the Evil One the next time he went out to him. In addition, he told him to carry a plowshare in his hand and when the devil asked him to give him his hand, he was to give him the plowshare instead. The man did this, too, when he went out to him the next night, and the devil grabbed it so hard that he kept a piece of the plowshare in his hand. Ever since then he didn\u2019t have to go out to the Evil One at night, but he got sick and wasn\u2019t fit for anything ever again.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["banging", "barn", "children", "day", "devil", "discovery", "evil", "grazing", "heath", "home", "horse", "minister", "neighbor", "night", "outside", "parish", "plow", "riding", "sickness", "verse", "wife"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Om Fanden og forbund med ham", "heading_english": "About the Devil and being in league with the Devil"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
