The wild hunter's dogs are usually red; that the hunter is described as green (and not wearing green clothes) is unusual. The puppies are cute, drinking the farm wife's wort, and eating her bread, but they also compromise her work in the kitchen for the day. In some variants, the hunter compensates the woman for her loss in a manner analogous to the compensation that the midwife to the fairies receives (DS II C 68). \n\n     Houses generally did not have doors on either end; instead, doors were likely to be staggered along the lengths of the building.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var ogsaa en Kone der havde to D\u00f8re paa\nhendes Hus en s\u00f8nden ud og en norden ud, det\nvar paa hendes Frammers og hu havde v\u00e6ret \nved at brygget og hu havde slaaet begge D\u00f8re\n\n3266B\naaben for at faa det koldt og gj\u00e6rd sat paa det. \nSe der kunde de kom ind og der drak de alt\nhendes Ut og s.
