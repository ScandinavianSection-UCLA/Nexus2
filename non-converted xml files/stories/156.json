Although Christiansen (1958) describes legends in which the devil is set to an innocuous task (for example making ropes of sand) while the person waits for assistance from a person more skilled in magic, there is no such salvation for the countess in this story.\n\n     One can read the countess's grisly death at the hands of the devil as a form of narrative retribution. In the previous legend, Jens Peter told of the poor treatment that the peasants received from the count, as well as the lax morals of the countess herself. In this story, the countess arrogantly attempts to undue the curse on the farm herself, rather than rely on the services of the Bragholdt hag for example, and her arrogance is punished decisively. \n\n      The punishment meted out by the devil is reminiscent of punishments suffered by those who have a pact with the devil (DS VI 144 and 150), and the countess's status as a wealthy landowner would make her equally suspect of this type of unholy alliance.\n\n     The countess transgresses numerous social norms during her s\u00e9ance. Bringing a draught animal into the house is unusual at best, and at worst proposes an inversion of the normal household organization. Enlisting the help of women of lower social status enacts two transgressions at once: First, it crosses the social boundaries that divide the classes and thus is reminiscent of her sexual dalliance with the farmer (JPP 2.05). Second, it exposes her hired hands to extraordinary danger, a reification of the mistreatment of workers for which she and her husband are known.\n\n     The black book, in Denmark referred to as Cyprianus, was often in the possession of both wise ministers and cunning folk. The name of the book is linked to Cyprian who was martyred in 290 (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 260). Here, the Bragholdt hag is a local cunning woman, even though Jens Peter describes her as a witch. Even though a Cyprianus would have been a prized possession, the countess would likely have had enough power to convince the Bragholdt hag to lend her the book.\n\n     Bragholt lies three kilometers slightly to the north and east of Baggesvogn. Later maps indicate two farms at Bragholt, \"Stor Bragholt\" and \"Lille Bragholt,\" probably a result of a division of the properties of the original Bragholt. It is unlikely that Bragholt was a manor farm; it was probably a large farm, perhaps a propriet\u00e6rg\u00e5rd. Again, the dating of the story seems unlikely, as the count at Baggesvogn in 1808 was Georg Moltke-Rosenkrantz, and not de F\u00e6dder. Of course, de F\u00e6dder's wife Kirstine did not die until 1826; she married Moltke-Rosenkrantz after her husband Chr. Peter de F\u00e6dder died, making Moltke-Rosenkrantz the count at Baggesvogn.", "danish_manuscript": "De havde\ns. mange stude paa Bagg. S. var det \nen Vinter de halve af dem d\u00f8de.
