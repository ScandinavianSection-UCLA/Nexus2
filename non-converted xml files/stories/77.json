The capriciousness of his punishments and the callousness of his actions resonate with the previous story of the cruel manor lord (BJK 3.13). That Tejl commits suicide--an act closely linked to Satan--is not terribly surprising, given stories that tell not only of Satan coming to get a cruel, high status peasant-tormentor but also of him convincing people to commit suicide.\n\n     The position of birkedommer, or independent district judge, was a position closely connected to manor farms. The birk was a jurisdiction sanctioned by the crown and independent from the district. Control of a birk allowed a manor lord and his appointed magistrates a great degree of power over the administration of the peasants who lived on the estate. The establishment of these independent judicial districts ended in 1809, and they were eliminated in 1849, insuring a more even-handed and consistent national approach to the courts and justice. Nevertheless, it was not until 1919 that the title of \"birkedommer\" was eliminated.\n\n     In Tang Kristensen's field diary, the last story was separated from the rest of the record by a small line, an indication that Tang Kristensen interpreted it as a separate story. However, it is clearly connected to the previous story, and he published all of the stories that dealt with Judge Tejl together.", "danish_manuscript": "Birkedommeren Kund Tejl i Torstedlund\nvar ogsaa et slemt B\u00e6ste, h. var fra\nTejlhus der nede paa Skj\u00f8rping Mark\nder havde h. en Broder der boede.
