Many of these remedies were ones that people had learned from local cunning folk, others were ones that they had learned from family members, friends or coworkers. This particular remedy relies in part on the magical power of the church and Christian prayer. Through the nineteenth century, many of the cunning folk were evangelical Christians engaged in faith healing (R\u00f8rbye 1976). The remedy also relies on sympathetic magic, where like produces like. Here, the diminishing numbers produce a similar diminishing effect for the warts.\n\n     The six remedies and spells that Kirsten Marie told may mark another break in the performance.", "danish_manuscript": "For gev\u00e6xter.
