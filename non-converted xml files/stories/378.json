Many of these stories tell of women who die undelivered and who subsequently haunt. Often they are solicitous, and ask for clothes for their child (DS V 1158; DS V 1164).\n\n     The incidence of out of wedlock birth in rural Denmark was high, but not overwhelming, and so it is unlikely that many women would see such a birth as a terrible problem. Rather, the problem lies in the adultery committed by the two.\n\n     Revealing the father's identity was a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it would ease the childbirth, but on the other hand, it would lead to censure for her and the feed hand. Despite the girl's fatal attempt at cover-up, her death and haunting acts as en even greater disruptive force than if she had simply named the father. Here the disruption goes beyond the feed hand's immediate family, and threatens the economy of the entire farm. Danish laws required that unwed mothers provide the name of their child's father. Not providing the name was, consequently, illegal.\n\n     Peder clearly endorses the strategy of using the minister to counteract the threat posed by haunts (Tangherlini 1999). Pentik\u00e4inen determined that engaging a solicitous haunt in conversation usually eliminated the haunting (1969). Even though the details of the negotiation remain a secret, the identity of the father must have been revealed in the conversation between the ghost and minister since he is identified in the story's orientation.\n\n     In Danske Sagn, this story is attributed to an unknown informant in Alken. There is nothing in the manuscript that supports this attribution, and the next story Peder tells is directly related to this story.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var da Pastor Pedersen var Pr\u00e6st i Svej-\nstrup da var der en Pige i Pr\u00e6steg. som\nblev besovet af Avlskarlen som var en\ngift Mand og da Tiden kom, te h. skulde\nf\u00f8de, s faldt F\u00f8dsl. s. sv\u00e6r og s. vilde de\nhave hende til at sige hvem der var F.\npaa Barnet for det plejer jo at kunne\nhj\u00e6lpe.
