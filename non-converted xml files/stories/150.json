Again, the haunt appears in the guise of a black dog (Woods 1959). The minister protects the children and then brings the dog outside to be conjured. Although he is successful, the conjuring leaves its mark on him (Tangherlini 1998). \n\n     In his story, Jens Peter engages in a bit of a rhetorical twist: the children promise not to say anything, but do so anyway. People then tell their stories to each other, keeping the minister out of the loop. This meta-performative remark describes a channel of communication in the parish where the minister, despite his centrality, was unaware of what the parishioners were talking about.\n\n     Tang Kristensen added an annotation in the published version identifying Hr. Knud Schott Deichmann as the minister in Torslev from 1792-1823.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Pr\u00e6st i Torslev der hed Deich-\nmann. H. brugte at l\u00e6se for Konfirmant\npaa Kirkegulvet.
