In this case, though, the man actually gets the treasure and the kettle in which it is held. But, as in other stories of interactions with the mound dwellers, their fortune appears as valueless. Here, there is no recourse to recover the lost treasure (as in some stories of midwife to the mound dwellers). Instead, he is left with the quite functional consolation prize of the coffee pot.\n     In the published version, Tang Kristensen eliminated the frame narrative, in which a junk peddler told of the treasure hunter. He also deleted the reference to swearing, thus rendering the story incomplete.", "danish_manuscript": "En Pjaltekr\u00e6mmer fort\u00e6ller, at en Mand i hans\nEgn (Aaby) var ved at kaste i en H\u00f8j, han\nvilde have v\u00e6k paa hans Mark og s. kom h.\ntil en Kobberkjedel.
