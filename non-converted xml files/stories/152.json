The soldier stands as a clear representative of both the peasant class and the protection of the nation from outside threat. Not surprisingly, when he finds himself at the center of an ambush, he is able to defeat his attackers, despite overwhelming odds.\n\n     The figure of the soldier is most commonly interpreted as a protector of the country. This notion had considerable currency in the aftermath of the Danish victories in the Three Years War and the valiant defense put up during the defeats in 1867. But in this story, the soldier plays a different role, protecting the economic fortunes of a single farmer, and by extension, the entire peasant class, rather than protecting the country. \n\n     The amputation of the robber's finger is an intriguing element of this story, and could be read as a metaphor for castration. The robber is permanently marked by the failed ambush, whereas the soldier and the farmer come through essentially unscathed (Tangherlini 1995).", "danish_manuscript": "En Soldat havde faaet Permission en\n2, 3 Dage og faaet Lov til at tage Sabbe\nlen med sig--det havde man ellers ikke\nLov til i de Dage.
