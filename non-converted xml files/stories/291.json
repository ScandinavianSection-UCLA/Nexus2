Her great grandparents are shown as compassionate and willing to go to great lengths to make Svine Karen comfortable. In turn, Svine Karen's piety so impresses Kirsten Marie's great grandparents that they decide to support her for the rest of her life. Voluntary support of the poor was a common feature of many of the proposals to reform the poverty assistance laws. Such proposals were popular in the rural areas for two reasons: they implied that the farmers were compassionate enough to support the local poor, and they did not require new taxes to support a widening welfare system. Of course, Kirsten Marie's parents' pledge of lifelong support for Svine Karen is easily honored, since she dies that night. The burial costs for Svine Karen would have been assumed by the local parish board as part of the public assistance to the poor.\n\n     The name Svine Karen means \"Pig Karen\" and it would not be unusual to nickname a poor, wandering woman with a derogatory name such as this. \n\n     The published version of this account is connected with the published version of KMP 2.15.
