Snart l\u00f8d det midt om natten, som om alle kv\u00e6rne blev sat i gang. N\u00e5r s\u00e5 m\u00f8llersvendene kom op for at se, stod alt stille. Snart var det ved sengene, at hun drev sin natlige sp\u00f8g med at tr\u00e6kke dynerne af dem, som l\u00e5 deri. Ja, det gik s\u00e5 galt, at de s\u00e5 hende ved middagstide ved bordet, hvor hun da delte eftermad ud til folkene, som hun plejede, mens hun levede. Men s\u00e5 snart \u00e9n talte om hende, n\u00e5r hun var synlig et eller andet sted, forsvandt hun straks. Til sidst, efter hvad der er fortalt, blev hun manet ned i \u00e5en, under m\u00f8llebroen. En gammel mand, der tjente hende som karl, mens hun levede, har senere fortalt f\u00f8lgende: Syv \u00e5r efter at m\u00f8llerkonen havde h\u00e6ngt sig, l\u00e5 a en nat hjemme i min egen seng og var helt lysv\u00e5gen. S\u00e5 h\u00f8rte a noget, der fuslede hen ad gulvet, og lige med \u00e9t stod der en kridhvid skikkelse for min seng og smilte til mig.

Why she did it, no one knew, but everyone knew that she walked again. Often it sounded like all the grinding mills had been started all at once in the middle of the night. Then when the miller\u2019s apprentice came up to check, everything was quiet. Soon she carried out her nightly spooking with the beds. She pulled the comforters off the people who lay in them. Yes, it got so bad, that they saw her at lunchtime at the table, where she served food to the people as she used to while she was alive. But as soon as someone talked about her, when she was visible in one place or another, she disappeared. Finally, according to what they say, she was conjured down in the river, under the mill bridge. An old man, who worked for her as a farmhand while she was alive later told the following: Seven years after the miller\u2019s wife hanged herself, I was lying in my bed at home and was wide awake. Then I heard something that was rustling across the floor and all of a sudden there was a chalk white shape standing by my bed and it smiled at me. I didn\u2019t get scared at all, even though I could see who it was. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cYou can certainly believe that I\u2019ve had a terribly hard time since I died, but now I\u2019m fine, so fine. I left here seven years too early and I\u2019ve had to suffer terribly because of that.\u201d \u201cGod almighty,\u201d I yelled, \u201cCan I shake your hand. Oh God, how you make me happy.\u201d But then she smiled at me again, waved to me with her right hand and then she was gone.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["apprenticeship", "bed", "belief", "bridge", "chalk", "comforter", "conjuring", "death", "disappearance", "farmhand", "floor", "food", "god", "happy", "haunting", "home", "lunch", "mill", "miller", "night", "old", "river", "seven", "table", "white", "wife"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Forskjelligt sp\u00f8geri og gjenf\u00e6rds nedmaning", "heading_english": "Revenants and their conjuring"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
