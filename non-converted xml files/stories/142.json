On the one hand, there was great suspicion that many of the poor were free riders, getting something for nothing. On the other hand, there was a strong movement against the earlier, paternalistic poverty assistance programs that robbed the recipients of their dignity and their rights as citizens.\n\n     That the minister is selling grain to the poor seems a bit unusual, as one of the minister's duties was to distribute assistance to the poor. The administration of assistance to the poor was, for the first half of the century, a direct responsibility of the minister. Many communities chose to provide assistance in kind, handing out specified amounts of grain on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, rather than give cash. With the reforms to the laws governing local administration in 1867, the administration of these services was assumed by the local parish council.\n\n     The minister's sale of grain may fall outside official public assistance to the poor and may simply be part of his own attempts to make a living. All parsonage's had land attached to them, and the minister was expected to supplement his income with the produce from his land. Here, the minister can combine entrepreneurship with Christian charity.\n\n     Tang Kristensen provided an annotation to the story, identifying the minister as Hr. Otto Rafn, minister in Harridslev from 1796-1821, a time when local assistance to the poor was handled by the minister.", "danish_manuscript": "En pr\u00e6st i Harridslev, Ravn, solgte Korn\ntil fattige Folk og h. plejede altid at\nsige, naar h. maalte den 1ste.
