Toothache was a significant worry in rural Denmark. Accordingly, anything that could stave off a toothache was likely to be well known and commonly practiced. Putting a dung beetle in one's mouth is hardly appetizing and conjures images of television shows such as Fear Factor. H.C. Andersen wrote perhaps the best account of the horror of the toothache in his short story \"Tante Tandpine\" (Auntie Toothache). The boy in that story dies from his abscessed tooth.\n\n     This particular remedy remained unpublished. Other remedies for toothache include sucking on cemetery mud (DS IV 2015), or other more involved rituals with horseshoe nails (DS IV 2016) or other sharp sticks (DS IV 2018)--a form of sympathetic magic.", "danish_manuscript": "Den f\u00f8rste Skarnbasse de fandt om Foraaret\nskulde de tage i deres Mund og s. rende lige\ntv\u00e6rs over Agrene og lige s. mange Agre\nde kunde rende tv\u00e6rs over lige s. mange\nAar var de fri for at have ondt i deres\nT\u00e6nd.", "english_manuscript": "They were supposed to put the first dung beetle they found in spring in their mouth and run across the fields and as many fields as they could run across that's how many years they'd be free from toothache.", "danish_publication": "Unpublished", "english_publication": "Unpublished version reads: They were supposed to put the first dung beetle they found in spring in their mouth and run across the fields and as many fields as they could run across that\u2019s how many years they\u2019d be free from toothache.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["dung", "field", "free", "mouth", "spring", "toothache"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Uudgivne historier", "heading_english": "Unpublished stories"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
