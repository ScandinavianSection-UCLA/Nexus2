The old sailor appears at first to be the voice of reason, refusing to join in with the rest of his shipmates. His solitary change of mind, however, puts him in a position of significant danger. Suicides absent themselves from community through the act of suicide itself and its aftermath. The self-centered pursuit of anything--wealth, fame or, in this case death--are generally decried narratively since all of these individual pursuits undermine community. The devil, of course, encourages the destruction of community. The Lutheran church considered suicide to be a sin, although Luther wrote: \"I don't have the opinion that suicides are certainly to be damned. My reason is that they do not wish to kill themselves but are overcome by the power of the devil\" (Luther 1967, vol. 54, 29). \n\n     In this story, the devil appears in the shape of a large, mysterious cat, one of his more common animal forms (Woods 1958). Interestingly, there is no appeal to religious symbolism in this story, which makes it unusual. In other stories of suicide, death is often averted by the use of such symbolism (JPP 4.06).\n\n     Suicide does not seem to be the goal of the sailors' bizarre undertaking. Rather, they seem interested in tempting death or, in this case, the devil. There is a small possibility that the men are engaged in a form of auto-erotic asphyxia as a way to pass the time, a suggestion that is hinted at in other stories (DS VI 431).\n\n      There are no statistics about suicide in the Danish navy from this period.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand nede i Jerup h. havde v\u00e6ret\ntil orlogs i den gl.
