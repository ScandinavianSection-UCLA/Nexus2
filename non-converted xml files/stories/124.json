There was a widespread belief in a free rider problem--that some people were using assistance to the poor because of their own unwillingness, and not inability, to work (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). Similarly, there was a widespread sentiment that the poor were not sufficiently thankful for the assistance they received. Jens Smed's response--to beat the ungrateful beggar--reflects in short order the frustration that many smallholders felt over the requirement that they contribute, through taxation, to the support of the poor.", "danish_manuscript": "Der kom en Stodder til en Grd i Aarestrup\nhvor Jens Smed boede.
