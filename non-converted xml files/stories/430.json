This variant provides greater detail about the actions of the parish clerk, while the earlier story provides slightly different detail about the ringing of the church bells. The published version expands considerably on the manuscript variant, and Tang Kristensen alters the position of certain phrases, presumably for greater comic and dramatic effect. This story is published in Vore f\u00e6dres kirketjeneste (1899), underscoring Tang Kristensen's apparently deliberate decision not to publish the preceding story (PJ 4.01).", "danish_manuscript": "Degnen i Mjessing h. brugte at spi\nse hans Meldmad i V\u00e5benhuset\nmidt han ringede. der skulde jo\nringes tre Gange.
