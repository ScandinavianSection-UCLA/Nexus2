The nisser were treated well since there was often a bowl of milk set out in the hayloft for them, and on holidays they got porridge with a big pat of butter in it. Because of this, the nisser were very willing to serve and sought out all different ways to benefit their masters. Thus it was common that they tossed hay and sheaves down from the hayloft. Sometimes for a joke they would throw sheaves down on people who came into the barn at night. Sometimes, the nisser would also steal from the neighbors. Between the farms there was a pond and when that was iced over, one often saw them crossing over it with something they had swiped from the neighbor\u2019s. It happened many times that they had both been out on similar errands and met on the way home out on the ice and on such occasions it often turned into an incredible fight, so that the plunder was scattered about all over the place.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["barn", "bowl", "butter", "errand", "farm", "fight", "hay", "hayloft", "holiday", "home", "ice", "joke", "milk", "neighbor", "night", "nisse", "plunder", "pond", "porridge", "sheaf", "theft"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Nisser", "heading_english": "Household spirits"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
