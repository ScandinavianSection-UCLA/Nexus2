Tuesg\u00e5rd may have been a farm that was abandoned during the eighteenth century, and placed under the control of a larger manor farm (See BJK 1.32 and 3.48). \n\n     Kirsten Marie alludes here to the land reforms of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There is little evidence that people moved back into villages and then back out onto the fields. On the other hand, rampant parceling of farmland into smaller and smaller plots resulted in cotter holdings that were so small that they could not support a family and subsequently contributed to the ongoing problem of rural poverty that was a main political and social concern up through the end of the nineteenth century.", "danish_manuscript": "Der er nogle store H\u00f8je henne paa Niel-\nstrup Mark der kaldes St\u00e5bdrup H\u00f8je.\nDer gik a og gantede Kreaturer (passede\ndem.
