Other reasons include attempted theft of the bell (DS III 529).\n\n     The bell represents a significant investment on the part of the community--or a benefactor of the community--and its loss would be quite significant. Economically, it is hard to imagine a small community being able to easily replace their bell. More important are the implications of the bell for community solidarity, as church bells were a clear sonic symbol of the community, used to call people together, to celebrate events, and to warn of calamity. It is worth noting that after his death, Peder willed a large sum of money to Skanderborg church to cast a new bell.\n\n     Lindow, in his discussion of the Delsbo churchbell, traces the loss of a bell in a lake to Gustav Wasa's repayment of the \"L\u00fcbeck debt,\" the debt he incurred in his fight against Christian II of Denmark (Lindow 1978, 63).
