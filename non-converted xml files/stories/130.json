The poor farmer fortunately recovers a treasure hidden presumably by robbers who pose a clear threat to the local economy (hence all the money). The man's discovery of the treasure is implicitly connected to his appeal to god, and the bargain that he strikes. When he begins the process of building the church--one of the few things that people can successfully do with found treasure since it represents a return of wealth to the community--he is approached by a wealthy local. The rich man, despite his promise, fails to build the other parts of the church, revealing the lack of trustworthiness of the wealthy. The rich man's failure to make good on his promise to build the bell tower potentially indicates a link between the rich man and the devil since, through his inaction, he damages the church. These actions are then used as part of an etiological tag to explain an unusual phenomenon in the man-made environment.\n\n     Suldrup church is six and a half kilometers north west of Ersted. Photographs of the church reveal that the bell tower was not completed initially. In 1944, a half timber spire was added to the otherwise foreshortened tower.", "danish_manuscript": "Skoven gik n\u00e6sten til Aalborg.
