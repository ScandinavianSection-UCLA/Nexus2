Here, the post officer uses the normal phrasing of the minister in legends of the would-be ghost (ML3005) when he confronts the prone figure of the priest. In those stories, the lack of response leads to the minister conjuring the farmhand. Here, the post officer with the same intentions as the minister in ML3005 to consign the devil to the realm of the dead takes aim with his rifle but the gun conveniently jams. The amusingly positive outcome is attributed to divine intervention.\n\n     The second part of the story plays on the concept of the minister speaking directly to the minister. Here, the minister, apparently slow on the uptake, wonders to whom the Lord is speaking, as Per is a common name (short for Peder or Peter).\n\n     Tang Kristensen provided a historical annotation in the published version, noting that P.T. Karmark was minister in Rold from 1721-1750. His successor was also named Karmark (S. P. Karmark), although it is unclear if there was a familial relationship between the two. By situating the stories far back in time, Jens reveals a startling degree of local historical knowledge, and diminishes the bite of the derision directed as the Rold minister in particular and ministers in general.", "danish_manuscript": "De havde en Pr\u00e6st i Rold der hed Karmark.
