Da hun s\u00e5 var begravet, gik hun igjen og var helt hvidkl\u00e6dt, hun gik og rodede inde i sengen ved b\u00f6rnene og ude i loen. S\u00e5 s\u00e5 de efter i sengen og fandt der nogle n\u00f8gler garn, og i loen hang der et r\u00f6dt skj\u00f6rt, som havde tilh\u00f8rt den d\u00f8de.

Da blev hun s\u00e5 bange, at hun tabte m\u00e6lken. Hun spurgte s\u00e5 pr\u00e6sten ad, om hun m\u00e5tte tale hende til. Pr\u00e6sten sagde da, at det kunde hun godt, men hun skulde tage en salmebog i h\u00e5nden, for hun vilde vist komme til at love hende noget, som hun skulde give hende h\u00e5nden p\u00e5, og s\u00e5 m\u00e5tte hun ikke give hende h\u00e5nden, men hun skulde r\u00e6kke hende salmebogen.

After she had been buried, she went again and she was dressed all in white, she went and rummaged about in the bed by the children and out in the barn. Then they looked in the bed and found some balls of yarn and in the barn there was a red skirt that had belonged to the deceased. They took it and hung it in the kitchen, but then the revenant appeared there. One time, when the son's wife went out to the kitchen with a pail of milk, she was standing there. She got so scared that she dropped the milk. She asked the minister if it would be alright if she spoke with her. The minister said that she certainly could, but that she should bring a book of psalms with her, since she would probably wind up promising the ghost something and the ghost would ask her to give her her hand on it, but she should not give her her hand but rather hand her the psalm book. So she asked the revenant once, \"What are you looking for, mother?\" -- \"Five shillings in the red skirt, then I can have peace in the ground, but promise me that you will give them to my daughter, and give me your hand on that.\" She handed her the psalm book, and the ghost grabbed it so hard that it left a mark. They cut the skirt up and found five shillings sewn into the waistband. Then they didn't see her anymore.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["ball", "barn", "bed", "books", "burial", "children", "daughter", "death", "kitchen", "milk", "minister", "mother", "old", "pail", "psalm book", "psalms", "red", "revenant", "sewing", "shilling", "skirt", "son", "white", "wife", "wind", "woman", "yarn"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Forskjelligt sp\u00f8geri og gjenf\u00e6rds nedmaning", "heading_english": "Revenants and their conjuring"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
