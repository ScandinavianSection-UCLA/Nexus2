Debates raged for many years over what constituted \"belonging\" in a parish, and the standard became five years residence (as opposed to the conservative position of birth parish). Poor people who tried to collect assistance in a parish other than their own were deported back to their parish. Beggars were subject to punishment, although in most cases they were simply returned to their home parish. Kalmar's punishment of Sidsel was unusually harsh. \n\n     The poor woman, Sidsel, gets her nickname \"heel\" in a typical fashion: a physical or personal trait becomes the basis for the moniker. In other cases, such as in the case of cunning folk, place names are appended as the nickname.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en hun bandt hendes ene Ben i Vejret\nog lavede sig et Par Krykker og gik omkring og tig-\ngede.

It was a seat plank with a large number of loads counted out on it, and when one man had driven he'd hand it off to his neighbor. But this here Sidsel couldn't do this in the areas where they knew her, and then she'd gone all the way over to Store-Restrup to beg. The foreman at the manor asked her where she was from, and she admitted that she was from \u00c5restrup so then he wrote to Kalmar and teased him a bit that he allowed people like that go around begging. There weren't any cripples like that on his manor. Finally they figured out that this had to be her, and so she wound up being forced to ride the wooden horse. She was there for so long that she'd almost died, that was a nice welcome for a woman. Soon after that, Kalmar got sick and died.
