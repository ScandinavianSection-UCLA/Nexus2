In earlier stories that she told during this collecting session, she had already mentioned the threat of elves as seductive beings (KMP 1.01) and the negative consequences of dancing with elves (KMP 1.42). Going insane is a common outcome of contact with elves (DS II A 74 and DS II A 76). The shepherd's disappearance is traumatic, but the people at the farm propose a likely, non-supernatural scenario to explain it. The truth behind his disappearance is far more startling, and only the farmhand's quick thinking saves the shepherd. By that time, the damage is already done. Indeed, in many stories of encounters with elves and mound dwellers, the human is often marked for life or killed (PJ 2.11). \n\n     The farmhand does not appear to be using the scythe in a magical manner in this story. In other encounters with the supernatural, the use of knives, other sharp metallic objects, or any worked metal for that matter, usually breaks the supernatural bonds that tie the victim to the other world, although not always with impunity (DS I 639).", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i Balle dere Flyttehjorde blev henne og var\nhenne i 8 Dage.
