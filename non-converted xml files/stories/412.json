Witches are an insidious threat to a community, since they come from within. In many stories, witches steal milk from the neighbors' cows after turning themselves into a hare (DS  VII 106), or by using sticks or other mundane objects (DS VII 584; DS VII 592). There was a strong belief that witches taught their children, particularly their daughters, how to be witches as well. \n\n     By the end of the nineteenth century, accusations of witchcraft had lost much of the legal power that they had had in the seventeenth century when proof of witchcraft could lead to a death sentence. Most discussions of witchcraft in the nineteenth century were more centered around folk healing. \n\n     The witch's strategy of meeting the threat of prosecution head on with a counter threat--and a plague of lice--is interesting. She at once confirms that she is indeed a witch (she has the power to visit a plague of lice on her accusers), and at the same time sidesteps prosecution. She seemingly avoids community censure, except for the fact that a narrative exists accusing her of witchcraft.\n\n     Skjoldelev is twenty-five kilometers north east of Fuldbro Mill.", "danish_manuscript": "Der har v\u00e6ret en Hegs i Skjoldelev.
