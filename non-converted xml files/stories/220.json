This association builds on a folk etymology that proposes a common stem for the word for elves, \"ellefolk\", and the word for alder wood, \"elletr\u00e6\" (AMJ 2.15 and KMP 1.60). Elves' backs are frequently described as looking like rotted tree trunks, an image that at once causes the human to recoil in disgust and reaffirms the close connection between these beings and nature, particularly forests (DS II A 59). The dance of the elf women that Kirsten Marie describes is similar to the dance of the mound dwellers who also attempt to seduce or kidnap humans into their community (PJ 2.11).\n\n     The food that the elf woman offers the man is reminiscent of legends about the mound dwellers' baking (Boberg 1938). In those legends, however, the food offered is part of a well-structured barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). In this case, the food is offered more as a gift; since the man has no history of interaction with this out group member, he is rightfully suspicious of the implications of the gift, particularly since elves are also seductresses (Mauss 1967).\n\n      The forest ranger's reaction--to cut a cross in the cake with his knife--is a common strategy to counter the potentially threatening supernatural gift. Here the threat is threefold, manifest in the pancake and the elf woman herself. The food may well be poisonous (as the food of the other world often is) and thus it could threaten the man's physical well-being. The woman may not only be attempting to disrupt the forest ranger's economic activity by distracting him with sex, but also may be trying to derail the normal ability of a community to perpetuate itself. The ranger's action serves at once as an expression of man's control over nature, in the form of the knife made out of worked metal, and the expression of the religious (Christian) nature of the human community, in the form of the cross he cuts in the cake. The efficacy of his action is clear, as it eliminates both the threat of the food and the threat of the woman.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Skovfoged i Nielstrup var over\nHval\u00f8se Vii.
