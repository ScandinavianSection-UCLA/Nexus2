Here, the cunning man plays a simple trick that relies on these widespread beliefs about cunning folks' abilities. The girl, who has no doubt heard many stories about the powers of cunning folk, decides on a strategy that will hide her guilt. Unwittingly, she stumbles into the trap and her transgression is revealed. Kirsten Marie may be suggesting that the cunning folk did not possess supernatural powers, per se, but were rather expert at human psychology. This evaluation of the cunning folk would align well with her stories about their failure to cure ailments.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand, der havde nogle Penge der\nvar bleven henne.
