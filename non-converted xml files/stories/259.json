Kirsten Marie also offers a short narrative to confirm the efficacy of the spell. Other spells make oblique references to religious figures (DS VI 973).\n\n     Bees were often kept as a means to supplement income and to provide honey which could be used in brewing.\n\n     A bee swarm is of course a threatening thing, both to humans and to animals, although it is unlikely that swarming honey bees would actually attack anyone. Nevertheless, animals might well be spooked by, and stampede at, the sight and sounds of a bee swarm. \n\n     A bee swarm usually indicates overcrowding in the hive and the queen bee often leaves the hive during a swarm. Consequently, a swarm might reduce honey production, and it would be important to any beekeeper to quell the swarm quickly and effectively. The swarm might also choose to move to another hive not on the beekeeper's property. Putting the swarm into a stone heap might be a temporary solution, but it would do little to help with honey production at the farm.\n\n     Tang Kristensen noted that the word toend\u00e9, written as one word in the manuscript, but as three words in the published version, is incomprehensible. Feilberg's explanation of the word toende, \"sweat profusely,\" makes little sense in this context (Feilberg 1977 vol. 4, 815). It is more likely that Kirsten Marie did not remember, or perhaps never knew, the words that finished her mother's spell.", "danish_manuscript": "B\u00e6jkorset.
