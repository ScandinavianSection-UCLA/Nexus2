Accordingly, the ability to stop a stampede would be greatly valued. Here, the stopping of the stampede relies on supernatural intervention (KMP 1.38). In many cases, the person who stops the stampede is a cunning person (DS VI 1004); in some cases, the stampede is caused by a witch (AMJ 2.20). The cost of stopping the stampede is nevertheless significant, and leaves a clear imprint on the farm's economy, as horses were a greatly valued asset.", "danish_manuscript": "De B\u00e6ster der bliver stilt. de duer aldrig\nmere.
