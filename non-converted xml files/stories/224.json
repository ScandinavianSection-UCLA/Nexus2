As in her previous stories, Kirsten Marie endorses a strategy that challenges extant power structures, in this case that of the Lutheran church. Much of the power of the Lutheran church was taken over by local landholders, including farm owners such as Kirsten Marie's brother Rasmus.\n\n     Here, the powerful ministers--three of them no less--are unable to conjure the ghost. The lower ranking curate, however, has little difficulty in conjuring the revenant, who is a constant disruption at the farm, and thus a threat to the local economy. Conjuring a revenant in a barn is not uncommon. Revenants are also frequently conjured down into the embankments of mill ponds.\n\n     The repartee between the revenant and conjurer is common in many variants of the story, and always revolves around the conjurer's youthful transgression of stealing out of necessity rather than greed (DS V 694). Paying back this debt during the conjuring allows the conjurer to gain power over the ghost.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Kapellan et Sted, der var en der\nskulde manes, h. var s. farlig til at gaa igien.\nDer var 3 Pr\u00e6ster om det og de var samlede og\n\n5212A\nsad hver med et Lys inde ved et Bord.
