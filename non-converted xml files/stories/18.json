Here, the manor lord recognizes the sign of impending peril--the blood red socks--and tries to develop a strategy to avoid the Devil. Unable to do so, he decides to take his money with him, by ingesting it. In other stories, \"taking it with you\" inevitably leads to haunting (JPP 1.08). Although the manor lord is unsuccessful in his rather pitiful attempt to eat the silver and generously gives the fortune to the hired girl, he apparently haunts the farm later (his haunting only appears in Tang Kristensen's emended published version).\n\n     The Devil in this story appears as the well-dressed gentleman, a widely attested form throughout northern Europe (V\u00e4lk 2001). His arrival in a fine carriage is also widely attested, mimicking the carriages of manor lords (PJ 2.01; 3.08).\n\n     While cutting live wood in forests was forbidden without specific permission from the forest owner (usually a manor lord or the Crown), collecting fallen wood was generally permitted. That people would not touch a fallen oak is significant in this context, and speaks to the fear that was attached through narrative to touching that particular tree.\n\n     Tang Kristensen makes some significant changes to the published story, adding detail that is not included in the manuscript. Most notable among these additions is the inclusion of a farmhand who confirms the haunting at the farm. Jens alludes to this haunting at the farm in a later, short unpublished narrative about Peder Yde and the place where Peder and the Devil crossed the stream (BJK 3.01). Several of the episodes--such as the girl's discovery of the manor lord's brain hanging on the walls of the room--are moved to later in the narrative.\n\n     The story has an elaborate coda that could stand as an independent story. The response to the villagers' query about the passengers stands as an amusing indictment of the power elites and their corruption in rural Denmark.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var en [B] Mand der boede i Teglgaarden\nen bitte Herregaard imellem Buderup og Skj\u00f8r\nping og h. havde gjort sig F. i Vold.

He says to her that she should get him another pair, he didn't want those. She got him another pair, but they were red too, and all the ones she brought were red. Then he says that he doesn't want to go to church today and she should put them away. Then he chased all the people off to church, everyone of them was to go except for the girl, she was to stay home. She was to get him a big bowl of sour milk, he said to her, and he put a bunch of silver coins in it, he wanted to spoon the coins into himself. She was to give him a spoon, but he couldn't swallow them. So he pushed them over to the girl, she could have them.

When they drove north to Hell--no one saw a trace of him any more but they asked about him later when he went over the sea with him, who he was. Well, it was the devil. And what freight did he have? Well, he had Andreas the bishop and Andreas Fal and Peder Yd'. Where were they from?
