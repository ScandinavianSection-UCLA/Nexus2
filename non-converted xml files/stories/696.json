S\u00e5 en aften kom manden hjem og fortalte, at nu var han vis p\u00e5, de nok skulde f\u00e5 ro i g\u00e5rden, han havde set, at alle ellefolkene flyttede om i naboens g\u00e5rd.

Han kunde m\u00e6rke, der var noget i b\u00e5den for hver gang, men han s\u00e5 ingen ting.

Then one night the man came home and said that now he knew that they\u2019d have peace in the farm, he had seen that the elves were moving over to his neighbor\u2019s farm. From that day on, they were free of them too. Then there was a woman who couldn\u2019t hear at all where they now were. But at night when the others slept she could hear that the elves tumbled about with the beer kegs because they were brewing at the time. Then, when they\u2019d lived in that farm for a long time, one night the ferryman rowed back and forth over the sound without stop without knowing what he\u2019d been rowing over and without being allowed to go ashore. He could feel that there was something in the boat each time, but he didn\u2019t see anything. Finally, when he was at the other side yet again, one came up to him and put another hat on his head, and then he could see an enormous crowd standing on the beach. Not until then did he understand what he\u2019d been sailing with. Then one of them came and gave him a full money bag, so the ferryman was from that day on a rich man.
