All of these cures rely on Christian prayer, and the laying on of hands. Rubbing a sprain might actually help in reducing swelling, but the efficacy of this cure is more tied to the recitation of the prayer and the laying on of hands. The short rhyme is a common feature of cures for sprains.\n\n     Fractures and sprains were a common occurrence on farms given the nature of the work. Although physicians had become an important part of the health care system by the late nineteenth century, sprains and breaks were often taken care of by \"benbrudsl\u00e6ger,\" or broken bone doctors. These people were not physicians, but rather local folk healers who had developed a specialization in setting broken bones. A special concession from September 5, 1794, allowed individuals who had developed this, or any other expertise in healing, to practice that specialty. Most applications for this type of waiver from the quacksalver laws were denied. The majority of accepted applications were for bone break specialists. The last permission for a bone specialist was issued in 1887. The law was finally repealed with the passage of the physician law of 1934 (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 279-80).", "danish_manuscript": "For Vred.
