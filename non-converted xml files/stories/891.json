Yes, she certainly could. \"I can also sit in here and milk milk from the cows.\" No, that couldn't be done. Yes, well if she was given an awl and a bowl. Then the minister came in and the others told him what the girl had said. \"Can you do that, my girl?\" Then the awl is fetched and the bowl too, and then she started milking. After she had milked for a while, she didn't want to anymore, because now blood started to come. Then he wanted to know who had taught her that. It was an old woman. She had put two cat tails in the oven and when she got one more, then she'd be fully taught. Then the minister had her re-baptized and then that was over, now she couldn't do things like that anymore.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["awl", "baptism", "blood", "bowl", "cat", "confirmation", "cow", "dancing", "girl", "milk", "minister", "old", "oven", "parsonage", "student", "woman"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Hekse og deres idr\u00e6tter", "heading_english": "Witches and their sport"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
