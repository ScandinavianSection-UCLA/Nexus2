Here, the two farmers' amusing speculation about how different the rich really are leads the one farmer to put his money (or at least his horse and wagon) where his mouth is. Double entendres add significant humor to the story. The man's final evaluation of the countess as no different from anyone else is an endorsement of the liberal policies that had taken root in the peasant class--as well as among the urban elite--that people were equal, regardless of social class and wealth. It was this liberal thinking that ushered in an era of broad social and political change, from the democratic constitution of the mid nineteenth century to increasingly progressive social policies up through the early years of the twentieth century.\n\n     The leaseholds under Baggesvogn were sold at the beginning of the nineteenth century, although many of these sales included villeinage. Villeinage was seen unanimously by farmers and smallholders alike to be an undue burden. One of the main goals of the Venstre party in the period after the promulgation of the constitution was to pass legislation that would substitute cash payments for the in-kind work of villeinage.\n\n    Baggesvogn is five kilometers north of Sindal and was originally built in the fifteenth century. The main building was built in 1744. The dating of the legend is a bit off, as the Count Feer alluded to in the story was probably Peter Chr. de F\u00e6dder, who owned Baggesvogn from 1799-1803. He married Kirstine Gleerup (d. 1826), who was the daughter of the previous owner, Mourids Gleerup (d. 1820). From 1803-1812, Baggesvogn was owned by Georg  Moltke-Rosenkrantz, who in turn sold the estate to Michael Aagaard, who went bankrupt in 1820. In the more than five hundred years since it was first mentioned in the historical record, Baggesvogn has had 38 owners. ", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i 1806 der var en Grev Feer\npaa Baggesvogn.
