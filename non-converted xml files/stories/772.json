One man thought about hanging himself, but had second thoughts about it when he felt something jump on his back and pull him down. He managed to name God's name, and it hopped off and he was saved. A girl wanted to drown herself. She was already down by the water to feel if it was cold. No, it was almost lukewarm, and the meadow had a strange shimmer, she'd never seen anything like it. She wanted to die, but first she wanted to say her Our Father. When she said amen, she heard a horrible scream that echoed across the meadow, and everything lost its beautiful gleam.
