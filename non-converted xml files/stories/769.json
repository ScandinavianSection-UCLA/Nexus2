He had to cross a heath that had a bad reputation. In particular, there was a place where there had been a farm that had been moved because of the sand drifts. When he got there, he was really frightened and read his Our Father. All at once, he saw a flock of hares that were running about among the piles of gravel playing. He could tell right away that they weren't really hares since their back legs couldn't bend. He made a decision at once. He went over to the flock and named a woman who was from a neighboring farm who was known as a witch. At once, the woman was standing there and said, \"That's the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me.\" She disappeared after that, and a little later she was dead. But the man didn't get away from that well. When he got to where he was going, he was sick, and was bedridden for a long time after.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["bed", "death", "disappearance", "evening", "farm", "flock", "friend", "hare", "heath", "leg", "name", "old", "Our Father", "parish", "reputation", "Saint Hans", "sand", "sickness", "witch", "woman"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Hekse og deres idr\u00e6tter", "heading_english": "Witches and their sport"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
