There are also many stories about churches or church bells that sink to the bottom of lakes as a form of divine punishment for the transgressions of the minister or parishioners (DS III 528, 529, 531, 533). Peder combines both motifs in this account.\n\n     The minister's ungodliness causes the church, perhaps the clearest symbol of the human community, to sink into the water, rendering it useless. That the church is still visible acts as an ongoing reminder to the fate that can befall the ungodly.\n\n     The parishioners' attempt to seize the treasure is also worthy of censure. In stories of the drinking cup stolen from the mound folk, the cup is most often used to build a church, or in some other way figures in the communal treasure kept at the church. The church itself stands as a form of community treasure as it represents the clearest protection against the various threatening supernatural forces that confront the human community. \n\n     The goal of the treasure hunt is personal enrichment, as opposed to the communal enrichment espoused by the drinking cup theft narratives. Not surprisingly, the treasure hunt fails (Lindow 1982). The apparent conflagration engulfing the town that interrupts the erstwhile treasure hunters, a common motif in these stories, is a clear physical representation of the destruction of the community's social structures that would ensue if their treasure hunt were to succeed. \n\n     The treasure hunters' solitary pursuit of wealth contradicts the ideal of community solidarity, yet aligns well with the emerging capitalist economy and incentives for individual success. The \"limited good\" model suggests that any such personal gain would come at the expense of others in the community; the new, capitalist model stressing individual initiative and success proposes an \"unlimited good\" model, where one man's fortune is not necessarily congruent with others' misfortune (Foster 1965).", "danish_manuscript": "Stilling S\u00f8 ligger der Kirke paa Bunden\naf.
