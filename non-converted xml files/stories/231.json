The final phrase is the funniest, as it draws attention to the unusual choice of godfather and godmother for the young boy, and the unusual decision to church Johanne on the same day as the boy is baptized.\n\n     Baptism was supposed to take place on the first Sunday after the birth in the local church (Steensberg 1964 vol. 1, 43). Women were churched--or accepted back into the church after the birth of a child--much later, usually six weeks after the birth (Steensberg 1964 vol. 1, 42). Accordingly, what Johanne proposes in this story is out of the ordinary. Implicit in the story is an attitude of condescension, both on the part of Kirsten Marie and on the part of the paternalistic minister, toward Johanne and her husband.", "danish_manuscript": "Mand og Kone kom og vilde have deres Barn\ni Kirke i Rud.
