There was a pervasive sentiment that these people could not be trusted and were dangerous. Such sentiment influenced legislation concerning the treatment of the poor up through the end of the century (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). At the same time, the incidence of alcoholism and its attendant problems, including violence, were quite high in this group (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).\n\n     Farms acting as informal inns were common. Many farmers earned extra money by selling their own distilled spirits. These private stills were illegal, and inspectors would occasionally confiscate the equipment and levy fines (see KMP 3.12). Offering lodgings and shelter to wanderers was a bit unusual, and obviously somewhat risky, but apparently an economically worthwhile business as well.\n\n     Peder's mother was born in 1828, and so this fight presumably took place in the 1830s.", "danish_manuscript": "Kj\u00e6ltr. loserede altid i min Moders F\u00f8degrd\nhvor der var som Smutkro og der kj\u00f8bte\nde dem altid en P\u00e6gl.
