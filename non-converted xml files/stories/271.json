Quite possibly, she took a rest while Tang Kristensen finished writing the long fairy tales she had just told him. When he was ready to start again, she returned to the realm of believable, everyday stories.\n\n     There is no clear evaluation of the doppelg\u00e4nger that she tells about in the story. Indeed, Kirsten Marie appears to be neutral about whether the farmhand's ability to be two places at once is good or bad, reporting it simply as an observed experience. Numerous stories attest to the divisible nature of the human spirit in Danish folk belief (DS VI 21, 33), a topic considered by Feilberg in his consideration of the spirit in Danish folk belief (Feilberg 1914). In this story, the farmhand is able to project himself back to the farm. The ability to appear to be two places at once could of course have its benefits.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Karl i Nielstrup, h. kunde gaa\nude i Stalden og synge, naar de andre Kar\nle kom og vilde gaa derind, s. tykte de h. \nvar der, men naar de kom ind, s. var h.\ninde ved Bordet og s. formodede de det\nvar hans Gjejst.
