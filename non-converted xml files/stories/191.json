The formula that the minister uses in both variants is almost identical, with the addition of the conjunction s\u00e5. The other direct speech episodes--the farmhand's final plea and the minister's powerless response--are also nearly identical. The only major change is the minister's interjection of \"Gud bedre mig\" [God save me]. Unlike the first version, the minister provides a justification for his late night peregrinations in the cemetery; this justification should have been enough to satisfy his wife, but she persists in her efforts to disrupt his tireless work to protect the community. As in the first version, the minister's wife loses her mind when she hears of the death of the farmhand. Jens Peter also adds a narrative intensifier, linking the story directly to his grandfather.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Pr\u00e6st i Mosbj\u00e6rg h. gik hver Af-\nten paa Kirkegaarden og hans Kone s. til ham\nrundt.
