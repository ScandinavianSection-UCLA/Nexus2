Here, the men encounter the unusual regiment on the march at night. The threat of war--and the threat of conscription that rested solely on the peasant class--must have seemed almost constant up through the late 1860s. \n\n     Kirsten Marie makes an interesting distinction between the wars that Denmark was either engaged in or recovering from. Most notable were the Three Years War (Tre\u00e5rskrigen) from 1848 to 1851 (F\u00f8rste Slesvigske krig, First Schleswig war), and the war with Prussia in 1864 (Anden Slesvigske krig, Second Schleswig war). In 1807, Denmark entered into a catastrophic alliance with Napoleon in an attempt to maintain control of the kingdom and the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenborg. England declared war on Denmark in November of that year after they had bombarded Copenhagen and confiscated the Danish Navy in September and October. The end result of Denmark's alliance with Napoleon was the loss of Norway to Swedish rule, and the bankruptcy of the kingdom in 1814. \n\n      The reference to the war of 1807, which appears at the beginning of the published variant, but at the end of the manuscript variant, may either be Tang Kristensen's own annotation, or it may be a response to a direct query from Tang Kristensen.", "danish_manuscript": "I mellem Nielstrup og Rud kirke gik to\nM\u00e6nd en Aften.
