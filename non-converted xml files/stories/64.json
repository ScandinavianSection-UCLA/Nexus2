According to Christiansen, the devil often reveals his real errand to his traveling companion, and asks that he not reveal it (1992, 35-8). The devil's errand in this case is to assist in an infanticide. More often, the devil is on an errand to collect a soul owed him for a previously sworn pact. Stories of averted infanticide are also common (DS VI 427). The devil, tricked by the girl's swell of maternal feelings for her intended victim, regrets having helped her during childbirth.  \n\n    Tang Kristensen eliminates the coda that appears in the manuscript, attributing the story to Peder B\u00f8dker. The only other person named B\u00f8dker who appears in Jens's stories is Anders B\u00f8dker, a cunning man (BJK 1.35).

Then she put the child to her right breast and it began to suck. Then he asks her if she won't do it. No, now she couldn't because the child had had her breast.
