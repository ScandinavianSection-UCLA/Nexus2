Somme tider, n\u00e5r hun skulde hen og hente sin m\u00e6lk, lod hun sin sorte potte, hun skulde have m\u00e6lken i, g\u00e5 forved sig. S\u00e5 slap hun for at b\u00e6re den, og s\u00e5 kunde hun g\u00e5 og binde p\u00e5 sin bindehose imens. Men det var ikke alt sammen godt, det hun gjorde. S\u00e5dan var der en g\u00e5rd, de kaldte P\u00e5skeg\u00e5rden, hvor en hel del k\u00f8er d\u00f8de, uden man vidste, hvordan det gik til. S\u00e5 kom manden da i tanker om, at det m\u00e5tte v\u00e6re \u00e9n eller anden heks, der var skyld i det uheld, han havde med sine h\u00f6veder. N\u00e5, hvad han har at gj\u00f8re, han f\u00e5r fat i en klog mand og sp\u00f6rger ham til r\u00e5ds. Den kloge mand vidste ogs\u00e5 straks, hvad der var at gj\u00f8re, og sagde til manden, at han skulde tage ni forskjellige slags tr\u00e6 og br\u00e6nde dem i et b\u00e5l. S\u00e5 vilde den, der var skyld i k\u00f8ernes d\u00f8d, komme, men de m\u00e5tte endelig passe p\u00e5, den ikke fik ilden at se. De gjorde, som den kloge mand havde r\u00e5det dem til, og s\u00e5 kom heksen fra Bjerge farende der hen. Hun pintes og hujede og vilde da endelig have lov at komme inden for, men de skulde ellers nok passe p\u00e5, hun ikke kom ind og fik ilden at se, for s\u00e5 var hendes pine v\u00e6k med det samme. Heksen m\u00e5tte s\u00e5 kj\u00f6nt blive uden for, og hun pintes og blev s\u00e5 gloende, at hun sprang i m\u00f8ddingsp\u00f8len for at svale sig. Endelig var da de ni slags tr\u00e6 br\u00e6ndt op, og s\u00e5 kunde heksen l\u00f8be sin vej hjem igjen; men i P\u00e5skeg\u00e5rden kunde hun aldrig gj\u00f8re ondt mere.", "english_publication": "A woman lived in Bjerge, Bjerge district, she could witch, and many people had seen that she could milk using two forks. Sometimes when she was to have milk she'd let her black milk can, which she was going to put the milk in, walk along in front of her. Then she didn't have to carry it, and then she could walk and knit stockings in the meantime. But not everything she did was good. There was a farm called Easter farm where a number of cows died without them knowing what was going on. Then the man started to think that there must be some witch or another who was causing this misfortune with his cattle. Well, what does he do, he goes and gets in touch with a cunning man and asks his advice. The cunning man knew right away what to do, and told the man that he should take nine different types of wood and burn them in a bonfire. Then the one who was at fault in the cows' death would come, but they had to be careful that she didn't see the fire. They did as the cunning man had advised them to, and then the witch from Bjerge quickly came over there. She complained and howled and wanted to come inside, but they had to be careful that she didn't come in and see the fire, because then her pain would be gone immediately. The witch had to stay outside, and she was tormented and got so hot that she jumped into the dung heap to cool herself down. Finally, the nine kinds of wood were burned up, and then the witch could run home again; but she could never hurt Easter farm again.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["advice", "black", "bonfire", "cattle", "cow", "Cunning Folk", "death", "district", "dung", "easter", "farm", "fault", "fire", "home", "milk", "misfortune", "outside", "pain", "stockings", "torment", "witch", "woman", "wood"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Hekse og deres idr\u00e6tter", "heading_english": "Witches and their sport"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
