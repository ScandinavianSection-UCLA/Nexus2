Det var alts\u00e5 siden marken blev udskift, og hendes fader pl\u00f6jede imod den.

It was after the fields had been reapportioned and her father plowed into it. Then he got his farmhand out there to help him dig a ditch around it, but it was so big that four horses couldn\u2019t pull it up, and he had four good horses too and really wanted to bring it back to the farm, it could have closed up a big part of the stone wall around the farm. But when he realizes that it's too big to freight it off, they decide to bury it. Then they had to dig a hole below it that was big enough for them to push it in, and it had to be deep enough that they could plow over it; that wasn\u2019t too hard because it turned out there was some beautiful white sand there that was easy to dig. There was some heather near Bavnh\u00f8j at that time, and it was starting to break up when my father ran into it. When the farmhand had gotten it dug out there were all sorts of raised letters on it, they weren\u2019t carved into it, more like they\u2019d been glued onto it. It was probably a stone that had stood over on Bavnh\u00f8j in the old days.
