It is interesting to note that Peder's witches are men.\n\n     The witches' ride to Troms church usually takes place on Skt. Hans eve (June 23rd) or Valborg eve (April 30th). Troms church is in Troms\u00f8 in Norway. This location makes the church sufficiently distant and, since it is built on an island off the northwest coast of Norway, sufficiently remote to be a conceptually impossible place to reach.\n\n     Witches were commonly thought to rest in church steeples along the way, and this leads to the amusing conversation between the two witches Peder recounts here.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en der hed Fin og en 2 der hed Rind og\nde skulde bes\u00f8ge hinanden.
