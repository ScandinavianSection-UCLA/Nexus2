Tang Kristensen was loathe to publish stories that were obscene, and there was clearly no way that he would publish this story. The self-inflicted mutilation of the greedy neighbor is an integral component of Jens's story, and the account would make little sense if he simply jumped over it. Instead, Tang Kristensen decided to eliminate it, and split the story into two parts.\n\n     Tang Kristensen had several other motivations for splitting these two parts of the story beyond the need to excise the obscene parts. By keeping the two stories together, he would have been forced to recognize the story as a fictional, humorous tale--it would neither fit into his conception of the legend, his conception of stories of daily life, nor his conception of the folktale. By breaking the stories apart, he found a reasonable solution that he felt no one would likely uncover. He could implicitly propose that the first part was a sad yet true commentary on the treatment and prejudice directed against wandering merchants--and as such an exploration of the tensions concerning the care for the poor that were an important issue in the politics of the time. The story would be classifiable as a legend, and quite at home in a section of Jyske Almueliv that was predominantly legends. \n\nThe second part of the story, without the obscene episodes, would then stand as an amusing jocular tale about farm implements. It would allow Tang Kristensen to foreground the discussion of farming implements that used to be common on Danish farms (echoing the reference to the old plow that the woman was forced to use in the previous story). As such, the story would be at home in the first volume of Jyske Almueliv.", "danish_manuscript": "--See 1.19--", "english_manuscript": "--See 1.19--", "danish_publication": "Som satire p\u00e5 det forhen brugte redskab, kan her s\u00e6ttes f\u00f8lgende historie: Det f\u00f6rste a kan huske, brugte de l\u00e6derrebe, der var lagt ligesom hamperebe er nu, og n\u00e5r de fik dem kj\u00f8rt i stykker, s\u00e5 kunde de bruge dem til plejl\u00f8le. De havde stavseltr\u00e6er eller sejltr\u00e6er p\u00e5 hestene. Det var den gang skik, n\u00e5r de havde f\u00e5et avlen i jorden, at de kj\u00f8rte til Nibe at hente sig et l\u00e6s sild. S\u00e5 var der en mand, han fik sig nogle store dramme der nede, og det blev aften, inden han kom fra byen. Den gang han kom s\u00e5 forbi Ugslev (Vogslev) kirke, s\u00e5 er der en stor bakke s\u00f8nden for byen, som han skulde op ad, og der satte han sig af og gik ved siden af vognen. S\u00e5 gav det sig til at regne s\u00e5 st\u00e6rkt. Da han nu var kommen et stykke hen, vilde han til at op at age igjen, men da var vognen v\u00e6k, og han kunde ikke se andet p\u00e5 hestene end puderne og de bare sejltr\u00e6er, for det regnede jo og var m\u00f8rkt. Nu vidste han aldrig, hvad han skulde gjore, men s\u00e5 satte han sig da op at ride p\u00e5 den \u00e6h\u00e5nds hest og red s\u00e5 hjem ad. Han kommer s\u00e5 hjem, tager puderne og sejltr\u00e6erne af hestene og h\u00e6nger dem p\u00e5 nogle store tr\u00e6kroge p\u00e5 nordsiden af laden, som de havde at h\u00e6nge deres redskab p\u00e5, n\u00e5r de kom hjem af marken om for\u00e5ret. Han g\u00e5r nu ind og fort\u00e6ller konen, hvordan han er kommen af sted, og han skulde jo hen og hente vognen, men nu fik det at v\u00e6re til dag, da det var et vejr, s\u00e5 det var forf\u00e6rdeligt. Men hen i dagningen blev det s\u00e5dan et bl\u00e6sende t\u00f6rrevejr, og ligesom rebene de t\u00f6rredes ind, s\u00e5 kom vognen, den var nemlig bleven st\u00e5ende p\u00e5 vejen, og rebene havde givet sig forf\u00e6rdelig i regnen. Den gang da klokken var ti, da havde han hans vogn og hans sild hjemme, den kom ind ad g\u00e5rden til ham. Han brugte de l\u00e6derrebe s\u00e5 l\u00e6nge han var mand, og han hed Ell-Lavst, vel sagtens efter hans moder.

They had stavseltr\u00e6er or sejltr\u00e6er [a wooden, lyre-shaped harness part] on the horses. It was the custom at the time, after they\u2019d planted, that they\u2019d drive to Nibe to get a load of herring. Then there was this guy who had a few large drams down there and it was the evening before he left town for home. Then when he came by Vogslev (Ugslev) church, there\u2019s a big hill there south of the town which he had to go up, and there he got down and walked beside the wagon. Then it started to rain hard. Since he\u2019d gotten a ways up the hill, he decided to get back up and drive, but the wagon had disappeared, and he couldn\u2019t see anything on the horses other than the blankets and the bare harness part, since it was raining and it was dark. Now he had no idea what he should do, but so then he got up to ride on one of the horses, and then he rode home. So he gets home and takes the blankets and the harness parts off the horses and hangs them up on some large wooden racks on the north side of the barn that they had there to hang their tools on when they came back from the fields in the spring. He goes inside and tells his wife what\u2019s happened, and that he\u2019d have to go and get the wagon, but now it\u2019d have to wait until the next day since the weather was so bad. But later in the day, the weather became dry and windy and, as the ropes dried up, the wagon came rolling in. The wagon had, in fact, remained on the road, and the ropes had simply stretched a great deal in the rain. When it was ten o\u2019clock, his wagon and herring were back at the farm, it came into the farmyard to him. He used those leather ropes as long as he was alive, and he was called Ell-Lavst, probably named for his mother. His son was called Ell-Jens or Jens N\u00f6rg\u00e5rd, and he inherited them. A stump of the ropes was still left when Peder Tygesen became a man, and he had enough with which to tie his thresher.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["barn", "church", "clock", "corn", "dark", "day", "disappearance", "dram", "Ell", "Ell Lavst", "evening", "fact", "fall", "farm", "field", "herring", "hill", "home", "horse", "inheritance", "Jens", "leather", "mother", "name", "north", "Peder Tygesen", "rain", "riding", "road", "rope", "son", "south", "spring", "story", "threshing", "tie", "today", "tools", "town", "wagon", "weather", "wife", "wooden"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Om fortidens landbrug", "heading_english": "Concerning earlier agricultural practices"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
