In this case, Margrete proposes that the local minister is the most competent to deal successfully with the disruptive force of the haunt.\n\n     By the nineteenth century, infanticide was a relatively rare cause of death, possibly a result of the progressive policies enacted in the eighteenth century that were intended to prevent it. Infant mortality for the Danish countryside through the nineteenth century ranged from a low of 6% to a high of nearly 25% (L\u00f8kke 2002). L\u00f8kke notes that approximately 10% of all rural births were out of wedlock--this percentage fell in the latter parts if the century as legal reforms were enacted and rural economic organization was liberalized. In the last decades of the century, it was common practice for couples to marry after the birth of their first child.\n\n     Executions in the early part of the century were often major events. Local soldiers surrounded the gallows to prevent people from getting too close to the spectacle (Steensberg 1964, 318). Capital punishment became less and less common during the course of the century. Christian V.'s Danske Lov, which was still in effect until 1866, allowed for the execution of a wide range of criminals, primarily to serve as examples for others. Earlier forms of execution and torture that included branding, dismemberment and the public display of the criminal's dismembered body, were abolished in 1833. Simple execution such as hanging was still allowed in the reformed law of 1866 for crimes such as murder and crimes against the state. The death penalty was not abolished in Denmark until the punishment reform law of 1930.", "danish_manuscript": "Paa pr\u00e6stegaardsmarken alleryderst ligger\nGalgeknolden.
