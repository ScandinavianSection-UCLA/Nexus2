In all of these cases, people assume the form of an animal; these creatures are usually most active at night. The close connection between mares and werewolves is further attested in numerous legends (DS II F 62).\n\n     The mare climbs on top of people or horses at night and \"rides\" them (KMP 1.37; DS II F 93-95) (Raudvere 1993). The victims usually suffer greatly and in some stories, die. There are some accounts of the mare riding plows, a belief that links the mare to the Wandering Jew (DS II F 106; KMP 2.02). The mare's actions take direct aim at the physical and economic well-being of the farm.\n\n     Belief in the mare is related to the English word nightmare. In Danish, the word for a bad dream is mareridt or, literally, \"mare ridden.\"\n\n     There are numerous strategies for dealing with the mare--often these strategies include Christian symbolism, such as the use of crosses. The best known \"cross\" for the mare is the marekors, an eight-pointed star, drawn in one continuous stroke (DS II F 90; KMP 1.37). Pouring water on the mare would usually stop the riding and reveal the mare's true identity (DS II F 73). Other stories tell of trapping the mare (DS II F 65). Turning one's clogs is also a well known prophylactic against the mare climbing into one's bed. The efficacy of this relies on the inversion of the clogs since the inverted status of the supernatural can be counteracted by another inversion.\n\n     The use of threshing knives, or other sharp objects, to catch and punish the mare is also widely attested (DS II F 54). The ensuing injury to the mare appears on the body of the person who transforms into the mare at night. This mode of capturing (and punishing) the mare is similar to various strategies for revealing the identity of a witch in hare's form, or the witch who rides a person to the witches' Sabbath. This last phenomenon is closely related to the phenomenon of being ridden by the mare.\n\n     Peder's suggestion that a person who is a mare has eyebrows that grow together over their nose is widely attested (DS II F 50). It is also known as a characteristic of people who are werewolves (DS II F 8).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en te M\u00e5ren red og han var s. meget\nslem ved ham og de laaste og de skaadede\nmen M\u00e5ren gik derind allig.
