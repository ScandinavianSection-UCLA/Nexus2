Humorous stories in which people accidentally claim huge amounts of butter from local cows are also common (DS VII 608). Jens Peter tells other stories in which witches milk cows to death or otherwise imperil a farm's livestock (JPP 1.02. 1.04, 4.14, 4.44). \n\n     The witch's theft of cream from all the farmers for her own personal gain makes clear her threat not only to the individual farmer, but to the community as a whole. While in some stories, tailors are suspicious characters, mostly they play the role of buffoon. The burlesque of the farmwife helping the tailor take off his butter filled pants is reminiscent of stories of extramarital dalliance.\n\n     Ane Marie tries to strike a bargain with the tailor, that he is not to tell anyone about her magical churning, but her bargain is no more effective than the threat against speaking that the minister makes to his confirmation class (JPP 1.09). Jens Peter makes use of these meta-narrative comments to great effect throughout his storytelling, implicitly explaining how he has come to know as many stories as he does.", "danish_manuscript": "Der boede en Mand i Ravheden, hans\nKone hed Ane Marie.
