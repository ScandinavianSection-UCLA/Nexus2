He interpolates the second line. The other two variants under that rubric refer to witchcraft. In the first, a woman is forced to carry her children for eight years before giving birth to twins. In the second, a witch reveals her curse, and the people are able to counteract it, allowing the witch's stepdaughter to give birth.\n\n      It is possible that this fragment belongs to the previous ballad, although the length of the measure, and the strong line separating the records in the manuscript mitigate against such an interpretation. It may however be related to the next ballad Jens performs, the well-known ballad of \"Redselille og Medelvold\" (DgF 271), although this verse is not attested in any other variants (AMJ 1.01). Most likely, it is a fragment of another ballad that Jens could not remember.\n\n     The reference to \"forty weeks\" (BJK 1.03) may also be in reference to this short fragment. More likely, the previous ballad reminded Jens of this short verse, but he was unable to remember the rest of the ballad.", "danish_manuscript": "Ja fyrretyve Uger og s. et Aar\nAk nej kj\u00e6re Moder det er ikke vist\nde fyrretyve Uger gik Marie med Kristus", "english_manuscript": "Yes, forty weeks and then a year\nOh no, dear mother, that isn\u2019t so\nthose forty weeks Mary carried Christ", "danish_publication": "\"Ja fyrretyve Uger og saa et Aar;\n[saa l\u00e6nge skal du med dit Foster gaa.]\"\n\"Ak nej, kj\u00e6re Moder, det er ikke vist,\nde fyrretyve Uger gik Marie med Krist.\"", "english_publication": "\u201cYes, forty weeks and then a year; \n[that\u2019s how long you will bear your child]\n\u201cOh no, dear mother, that isn\u2019t so,\nfor forty weeks Mary carried Christ.\u201d\n", "keywords": {"keyword": ["bear", "child", "Christ", "mother", "week", "year"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Jyske Folkeminder", "heading_english": "Folklore from Jutland"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": null}, "genre": null}
