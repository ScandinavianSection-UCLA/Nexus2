Unlike in the first telling, this story does not comprise part of a longer series of stories about events at Baggesvogn, nor does it lead into another story about the Bragholt hag (JPP 2.05-2.07).\n\n     There are some minor differences between the two versions, likely attributable to aspects of the immediate performance context. Several of the unbound phrases--particularly in relation to the three tears appearing in the boy's comforter--have been moved. Jens Peter adds additional detail in this variant, including the name of the room. Finally, he adds a coda about cleaning the room and the eventual need to physically rebuild the room to get rid of the haunting. As in the previous story, Jens Peter links the account to his immediate family. He does not provide a precise date (1808) as he had in the earlier telling. Johannes Kristoffer Nyholm took over Baggesvogn in 1837, purchasing it from the state for ninety thousand rixdollars. He was succeeded after his death by by his son, Hans Christian Nyholm, who kept the estate until 1880.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Grev Feer der boede paa Baggesvogn\nh. og hans Kone er begravet paa Sindal Kirke-\ngaard.
