In some stories, it is suggested that Odin's hunter hunts supernatural beings, particularly elves (DS II C 78). He is often accompanied by several dogs. \n\n     The name shows great variation across stories. In many stories, he is referred to as Wojens hunter. One variant suggests that he comes from the town of Wojens in Salling (DS II C 25). Other stories suggest that the hunter is King Valdemar (DS II C 36). \n\n     Many stories propose that the hunter has made an agreement with the Lord to be allowed to hunt for all eternity (DS II C 24). Feilberg provides an exhaustive list of attestations of Odins j\u00e6ger in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and German collections (Feilberg 2, 730-3). Lindow notes that the earliest attestation of this story comes from a Cistercian monk, Heliand de Froidmont, in a text preserved by Vincenz de Beauvais (Lindow 1978, 116). In Nordic mythology, Odin is not known for either hunting prowess or for keeping dogs. Wolves, yes, dogs, no.", "danish_manuscript": "A har h\u00f8rt Uens J\u00e6ger en Aften.
