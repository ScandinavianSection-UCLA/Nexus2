In Kirsten Marie's story of a marriage between a Dane and a gypsy, the outcome is tragic (KMP 1.33). In this story, the marriage is more of an aside, and hardly a cause for approbation, worry or sorrow.\n\n     Although this story is reminiscent of Kirsten Marie's story of tricking a stodderkonge [beggar bailiff] (KMP 1.03), there are several important differences.  In that story, the stodderkonge is made to look foolish; here, the poorer farmhand simply takes advantage of an opportunity to get a little money from a person both drunk and known to be generous. The reversal of status--essentially begging from a natmand--is amusing, and does not seem to be worrisome to either Elias or Jens T\u00e5rs. \n\n     The apparent wealth of the gypsy aligns with the story of the gypsy birth banquet from Kirsten Marie's repertoire (KMP 2.07). In her story, the gypsies' wealth is a cause for suspicion and can be interpreted in the context of widely held conservative views of poverty assistance laws. Jens Peter seems to be more accepting, if not downright impressed, by Elias's wealth, and there is little implication that Elias is engaged in anything illicit. \n\n     Elias is criticized for being a snob,  something that is hard to imagine given the status of gypsies and natm\u00e6nd in rural Danish society. His desire for respect violates the unwritten rules of social decorum known as Janteloven [the Law of Jante] articulated by Aksel Sandemose in his popular novel, En flygtning krydser sit spor (1933). Elias's generosity makes up for his apparent desire to move up socially.  Unexpectedly, his wealth stems from his natmand work, as Jens Peter mentions in the story that Elias was on his way home to slaughter a horse. \n\n     Again, Jens Peter loads his narrative with local place names, and situates events and people in this narratively rich landscape. The mention of Natmandsbank [Nightman's Hill] reveals the degree to which the separation of this class of people permeated the local landscape. Interestingly, Jens Hansen moves out to this area once he marries into ELias's family. This would be akin to marrying down, since Jens Peter tells us that Jens Hansen was a farmer's son. But Elias's wealth seems to mitigate this problem.", "danish_manuscript": "Elias var den f\u00f8rste Tater, der bosatte sig i\nTaars.
