Kirsten Marie frequently recounts the adventures of her father in her storytelling. In this case, her father plays a good-natured trick on the beggar bailiff, the man charged by the local authorities with keeping beggars from outside the parish away. The beggar bailiff was generally chosen from local people receiving poverty assistance. This primitive form of control over the movement of itinerant beggars was intended to keep the burden of poverty assistance at a reasonable level throughout the parish.\n\n      Kirsten Marie's obvious delight in her father's antics that indirectly challenge the local governing board, while directly teasing the low status beggar bailiff, reveal her attitudes to a relatively complex series of status divisions functional in late nineteenth century rural Denmark. Kirsten Marie's father is, at the time of the events, a hired hand, and only incrementally better off than the beggar bailiff. His masquerade as a beggar enacts this tenuous divide. By contrast, when Kirsten Marie tells the story, she sees herself as a farm owner's wife, and thus narratively parallel to the farmer's wife who provides alms for the false beggar and the beggar bailiff. The farmwife in the story is narratively powerful, aware of the identity of the false beggar and firm in her protection of him from the otherwise justified actions of the beggar bailiff, Rasmus.\n\n     The story enacts an amusing twist with Kirsten Marie narratively allowing her (and her brother Rasmus's) father to toy with an officer of the poverty assistance board, thereby questioning the efficacy of that office. In this context, it is worth noting that Kirsten Marie's brother, Rasmus Kj\u00e6r, was an important figure in local politics at the time she told the story.\n\n     The second part of the story where Kirsten Marie's father steals the beggar bailiff's food is reminiscent of a well known contemporary legend in which a person mistakenly eats someone else's food, often on board a train or at a cafeteria (Klintberg 1986; Zola Christensen and Christensen 2001). Those stories, referred to in Danish under the rubric of \"Snylteren,\" rely on a twist: the main character believes a person is openly and aggressively stealing his or her food but subsequently discovers that the apparent thief was actually the victim. Once the tables are turned, the smug protagonist is mortified over his or her breach of social etiquette and the theft.\n\n     By contrast, in this story, there is no significant question of etiquette; rather, the false beggar is crass and deliberately aggressive, as is the beggar bailiff. The beggar bailiff never has an opportunity to regret his subsequent actions, since he never discovers the underlying ruse. \n\n      The concept of theft functional in this story is more complicated than in the contemporary legend, since it depends on an economic interpretation of begging. Begging was seen by some as a form of theft: the receipt of goods without payment or any service rendered. In the story, that equation is made explicit in the actions of the false beggar: the theft of food right off the plate of the beggar bailiff, the person charged by the community with protecting the borders from the incursion of foreign beggars, read thieves. Yet, here, the beggar is not what he appears, and the underlying \"theft\" associated with begging is revalued by the farmer's wife, who proposes charity. \n\n     The false beggar makes explicit the implication that begging is thievery in his provocation of the beggar bailiff who reacts accordingly. His reaction, however, is rebuffed by the farmer's wife, and the beggar's bailiff is forced to relent. The farmer's wife, through her actions, paradoxically endorses a position of local charity that countermands the office of the beggar bailiff, an office that was based on the premise of surveillance, control and punishment (J\u00f8rgensen 1940; Foucault 1979). The narrative focuses on the charitable act of the farmer's wife rather than on the implicit and explicit thievery of the (false) beggar.\n\n     There is little difference between the manuscript version and the published version. In the published version, Tang Kristensen moves the reference to the beggar bailiff to the beginning of the story's orientation, downplaying the emphasis Kirsten Marie places on her father. Kirsten Marie--or perhaps Tang Kristensen--introduces a degree of confusion into the story at the end, accidentally referring to her father as \"Rasmus,\" the name that she has been using for the beggar bailiff throughout. The name is dropped in the published version.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Fader tjente i Stubdrup og s. havde de en\nStodderkonge i Nielstrup.
