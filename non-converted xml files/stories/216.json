While some have argued that the \"Norwegian\" in theseis actually a S\u00e1mi, there is little evidence in any of these stories that support this surmise. Instead, it is likely that this explanation obtains in Sweden and Norway in reference to Finns, where farmers would have been in contact with S\u00e1mi, but not in Denmark, where meeting a S\u00e1mi would have been a truly unusual event.\n\n     The curse undermines the already shaky economy of the farm, an economy made all the shakier by the burden of the farmer's villeinage at \u00c5strup (the farm is presumably a leasehold under the estate at \u00c5strup). The farmer's generosity to the wandering Norwegian leads to a reciprocal relationship, similar to the one between the farmer and the mound dweller found in the preceding story (JPP 4.43). The curse on the farm is a fairly typical witch's curse, and is intended to destroy the farm's economy. The form of the curse relies predominantly on contagious magic, with the bones and skin of the animals used to control and kill the farm animals. Not surprisingly, the witch turns out to be a neighbor, and the neighbor witch begging to be let in is a widely attested motif (DS VII 1357).\n\n     As in many of his stories, Jens Peter vouches for the veracity of the story by emphasizing his personal connection to someone in the story, or someone who knew someone in the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en M. i N\u00f8rre Harridslev\nh gjorde Hoveri til Aastrup ve-\nsten Hj\u00f8rring og h. mist da saadan\nen Masse H\u00f8veder baade Heste og\nK\u00f8er og Faar og Svin og Gj\u00e6s og \u00c6nder\nog H\u00f8ns, kort sagt alt hvad h.\n\n7824A\nhavde og h. var s. rasende fattig.

He had four horses, but two of them were so thin and weak that they couldn't do anything. They hung in some ropes and were near death. The man was supposed to go to L\u00f8kken with a load of grain for the manor lord and had to have these two horses harnessed up. At the time an old Norwegian had come here to the country, he was cunning and could cure such things. He was supposed to have helped many others. Then there were some who'd told him about this farmer and how bad off he was. He goes over there and comes on the evening that the man was out driving to L\u00f8kken and wanted to talk to him about that. But the man wasn't home then. Then he asks the farmer's wife if he can't stay there that night. No, she says no, that couldn't be done. They were poor people and couldn't afford to have strangers lodging with them and she was harsh and chewed him out. But he just kept sitting there since people had told him to stay until the man came home.

He had a bottle of akvavit along home from L\u00f8kken and they sat there and emptied it that night and were feeling good. Then this here old Norwegian became a little more talkative. Then he says, \"How is it that you lose so many cattle and horses?\" Well, he couldn't stay at the farm, he says, he was about ready to leave it any day now, because he lost everything, and it was probably evil people who were at fault. Well, then the Norwegian starts to talk and says, \"There's a remedy for that.\"--No, says the man, he'd given a lot of money to have it cured and there'd been a lot of cunning folk. \"Well, let me stay here tonight,\" says the Norwegian, \"then we can take a look at it tomorrow morning.\" He stayed there and the next morning, they got up and he says to the wife, \"Take an entire basket of peat and make a fire in the fireplace.\" Yes, she'd do that. \"Well, then we'll go out to the barn and see if we can't figure out a remedy for this.\" The Norwegian went back and forth in there and then he pointed at a large stone that was lying there in the stone floor and they were to pull it up. No there wasn't anything under it, they could put it back down. Then he went back and forth a couple of times, and then he says, \"It should be here,\" there was also a big stone in there. They got a metal bar and lifted the stone. Underneath it there was a hole big enough to fit a couple measures. There were also all sorts of bones, both horses and cows and pigs and the like, and there was hair from them too, and there were bones and feathers of chickens and and the like and tied onto these hairs were so many bad luck knots that the cunning man filled a two bushel basket when he'd gathered it all together and carried it out. Then the Norwegian calculated by looking at all that that it could have lasted for another hundred years that they'd lose animals at that farm before it would have ended. They carried it into the kitchen. Then they had to shut all the doors and windows tightly and plug all the holes in the main room, because now they were going to throw everything that was in the basket onto the fire, and the evil-doer would come immediately. It wasn't too long after all those things and the bones were on the fire before their neighbor's wife came and really wanted to come in, and she yelled and screamed, she really needed to talk to them. But she wasn't allowed to because the Norwegian was afraid that it wouldn't help if she came in, and so she wasn't allowed in.
