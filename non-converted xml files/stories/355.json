Often, the corpse lamb is missing a leg and travels about only at night.\n\n     This variant differs from the one Tang Kristensen collected from Margrete five years earlier (AMJ 2.19). Here we learn that Margrete's father was born on a holiday, a liminal time in the year, and this affords him second sight. The threat posed by the fox, a main component of the complicating action of the earlier variant, is missing from this variant, while the role of the corpse lamb as an omen for an impending death is more fully developed.", "danish_manuscript": "Min fader er f\u00f8dt selve Pintsemorgen og\n6717B\nhan kunde se alt Skidteri.
