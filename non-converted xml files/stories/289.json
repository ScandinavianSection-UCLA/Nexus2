Such treatment of the dead could provoke haunting (Pentik\u00e4inen 1969). Minister's wives were also prone to haunting as numerous stories link them to the devil. \n\n     When the minister's wife awakens, the parish clerk believes that she has returned from the dead and, out of sheer terror, runs off. Since the wife has already been prepared for burial, the hired girls believe, as does the parish clerk, that the wife has come back as a haunt.\n\n     A haunting would require the minister to conjure her and his interaction with her seems to be leading toward that. But her use of the Lord's name, in this case paradoxically as part of a curse, confirms that she is in fact alive. As such, the story amusingly undermines all of the characters' expectations, expectations that are informed by other stories of ghosts and conjuring.", "danish_manuscript": "Pr\u00e6stens Kone i Haslum hun var skind\u00f8d\ns. skulde hun jo s\u00e6ttes ud i Kirken\nom Natten f\u00f8r hun skulde begraves.\nsaadan var det skik den gang.
