Here, the postal carrier is a representative of the Crown, and presumably sees himself above the law. The tension between the desire for local control and the role of the central administration (first the Crown and then the state) were constant, and informed a great deal of the debate over legislation concerning local rights through the latter half of the nineteenth century. \n\n     One of the main forms of public transportation in Denmark, prior to the development of the railway system in the 1860s, was the system of postal wagons. In fact, carrying passengers was as much a part of the postal service as carrying mail (Hvidt and Olsen 1990, vol. 11). \n\n     The district bailiff, reluctant at first, finally comes to the help of the local man. The willingness to let bygones be bygones might well be related to the tension that existed between the local government and the distant central authority of the Crown. The final scene in the restaurant where the two plaintiffs wind up paying for the defendant's lunch is reminiscent of one of Peder's earlier stories, in which the young farmhand tricks his antagonists (PJ 2.27).\n\n     Bremerholm in Copenhagen was a forced labor institution, originally a ship wharf, with the first prisoners sent there in the 1570s. According to Christian V's Danish law of 1683, the man from Bukballe would have been subject to Book 6 Chapter 4 Article 16 of the criminal code, which states, \"Overfalder nogen sin af Kongen forordnet \u00d8vrighed i deris Embede, straffis paa \u00c6re, eller Boeslod, efter Sagens Beskaffenhed\" (If anyone assaults any of the king's officials who are carrying out their duties, the punishment is either fine or imprisonment depending on the severity of the offense). The statute allows for a great degree of latitude. Punishment at Bremerholm, where one worked in irons, was generally considered \"the last possible punishment,\" and three years at Bremerholm would have been a considerable punishment. Interestingly, many of the statutes of Christian V's law were in effect up through the 1860s, and some still echo in contemporary Danish law. \n\n     Frederik VI (1768-1839) became king of Denmark in 1808. It was during his reign that Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden in 1814.", "danish_manuscript": "Om paa Grumstrup Mark, Vedslet Sogn\nligger Hede M\u00f8lle.

It was owned in its time by a district bailiff, who was in charge of Hads district. The river formed the boundary between the districts, and he had to build himself a house on the Hads side of the river to be in his jurisdiction, while the mill itself lay in another. He knew so much about the law that people often sought him out to solve disputes, particularly poor people. At that time, the royal post drove between Horsens and Aarhus, past Vedslet Kirke. There was this man up on Baastrup Mark, who lived at a farm called Bukballe, and he had to go to Aarhus. He goes out and wanted to come up and ride with this postal carrier. But the postal carrier was a moody fellow, and the two must have had a bit of an argument. So the other one has to walk behind but stays close to the wagon anyway so when the guy drives into the farm courtyard, and unhitches the horses, the man comes up, knocks one of the bridles out of his hands, and beats him silly in front of witnesses. It was a dangerous thing to do to lay a hand on the Royal Post, and he was naturally reported and had to go and defend himself in court. The least punishment he could get off with was to spend three years at Bremerholm, and he might even have to spend the rest of his life there. They asked all the wise legal minds both in Aarhus and in Horsens, but nobody dared help him. Then there was a man who lived down here in the forest, who was called Jep, he went up to him and said, \u201cHave you gone over to the guy at Hede M\u00f8lle and asked his advice?\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo, I haven't, because I threatened him last year.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, I'll try going over there and see what there is to do about this.\u201d So he went over there. \u201cWell, if it had been anybody else but I don't think I want to help him, because he showed himself to be not so nice last year.\u201d This man persists and finally he says, \u201cWell, you can come down here tomorrow night, then I'll give you an answer.\u201d He left. \u201cWell, things aren't too bad, you can tell him that he should show up at next assembly day in Horsens, and he can bring a couple of men with him, if he wants.\u201d So they meet too, and they go into a bar. \u201cYou can eat and drink what you want, we'll get it paid for.\u201d He had two men along with him himself. Then he left, and came back a little later with the postmaster and the town bailiff. Then he says to the man, \u201cHere are the two men who have charged you, and you can go now. Whatever you've eaten, will be paid for by these two men.\u201d Then that court affair was done with. Jep went down to the district bailiff later and said, \u201cHow did that happen, that you could save the man, without having to go to court or to the assembly?\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, I'll tell you. They'd also broken the law.
