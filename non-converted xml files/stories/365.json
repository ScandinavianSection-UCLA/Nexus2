Her interactions with the landlord reflect the often harsh conditions that confronted those who were forced to rent, rather than own, their own lodgings. By the 1840s, the potential for abuse represented by the rented houses (lejehuse) had become a major issue in the peasant movement. In a communication with Grundtvig, for example, Peter R\u00f8rdam (1806-1883), minister in Mern, insisted that the practice be abolished entirely. The problems with finding and keeping suitable housing resonate with Margrete's proverbial expression (AMJ 1.09) and a fairy tale (AMJ 2.02) she had performed five years earlier.", "danish_manuscript": "hvidslaven\n6719B\nLav a boede ude i et Hus i skoven Haarup\nKrannestrup laa der  en Hugorm i vor\nseng om Natten.
