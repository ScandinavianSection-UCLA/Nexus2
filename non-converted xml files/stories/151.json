In these stories, groups of robbers are frequently described as having dens from where they can monitor activity on the road through the use of a primitive alarm (DS IV 1447 and 1449).\n\n     The horse dealer probably feels that the innkeeper's warning is suspect, since other stories attest to the villainy of larcenous innkeepers (DS IV 1376 and JPP 2.14). \n\n     The horse dealer's escape from the robber is not unusual, and Jens Peter's next story continues in the same vein (JPP 2.02). Although the robbery is initially successful, the horse dealer is able to appeal for help from the local manor farm's huntsman. The thief is killed and the money recovered--essentially reestablishing the economic order that was in peril at the beginning of the story. Because robbers often worked in groups, the inability to further question the robber implies a continuing threat there in the woods.\n\n     The robber's use of the long knife relates him to another famous Danish thief, Jens Langkniv [Longknife] who, in some stories, appears as a Danish Robin Hood (DS IV 1466) (Jensen 1993). Langkniv was an alias of Jens Olesen who was the subject of numerous legends, a novel by Jeppe Aakj\u00e6r (1915), and a film in the 1940s directed by Per Knutzon and Peter Lind (considered by some film critics to be among the very worst films ever made).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Hestehandler der kom syd fra\nover Fjorden og vilde til Marked her nede.\nH. kom saa til en Kro, der hedder Lang-\nbro Kro nord for Sundby -- den G. gik\nVejen over Jerslev Broe.
