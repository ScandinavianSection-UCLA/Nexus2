The requirement to say \"in the name of Jesus Christ\" or some other religiously charged formula protects the farmhand from driving off with a Satanic being who, presumably, would be unable to utter such a religiously powerful formula. When the carriage cannot budge, Master Laust forces the ghost to serve as the fourth wheel of the wagon and they return quickly to the parsonage. In other variants of this legend, it is Satan who is forced to act as the fourth wheel (DS VI 323). The Lutheran church, to combat widespread belief in ghosts, made ghosts theologically acceptable by equating them with Satan (Tangherlini 1999).\n\n     In other variants of the legend, the farmhand tries to witness the conjuring, resulting in the minister's momentary loss of power over the powerful revenant (DS V 730, 744). As in the story of Dorrit, Kirsten Marie provides no details about the conjuring. Conjuring a ghost in the cemetery is not surprising, as the cemetery is the most obvious resting place for the dead.\n\n    The story concludes the series of stories that revolve around Mr. Dorrit, Master Laust and local ghosts.", "danish_manuscript": "Da Mester Lavst en Aften kj\u00f8rte fra Aarhus, saa\n\n5212B\nh. at der var Lys i Trige Kirke og s. s. h. til\nKusken, at ha. skulde holde, for der var Lys i Kir\nken og s. gik Mester Laust derind og s. til Karlen\nidet h. gik: Nu bliver du holdende og der maa\nikke kj\u00f8re inden der kommer en og s.
