Grundtvig proposed that the ballad came to Denmark via northern Germany, and was no older than the fifteenth century. It was widely circulated as a broadside, and was published as number 17 in Peder Syv's collection. The version that Jens knows is based on a broadside, with an earliest attestation of 1648.
