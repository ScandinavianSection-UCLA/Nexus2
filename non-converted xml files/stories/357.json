The minister, as in the earlier variant, is presented as a wise minister (klog pr\u00e6st), a figure balanced on the fine line between the ecclesiastic and spiritual function of a minister on the one hand, and the more questionable realm of magic on the other hand.\n\n     Five years earlier, Margrete had told another version of this same story (AMJ 1.06). This variant diverges little from the earlier telling. Margrete provides slightly more detail about the suicide, such as his name and the location of the hanging.
