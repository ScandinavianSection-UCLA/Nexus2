In many stories about the poor, there seems to be an underlying sense that these people are \"different\": they speak differently, they act differently, they wear unusual clothes. This \"difference\" comes to the fore in other stories about night men (natm\u00e6nd), knackers (rakkere), and other vagabonds, in which the difference is also based on ascribed ethnicity. Even though most natm\u00e6nd and rakkere were ethnically Danish, they were often lumped in with ethnic outsiders such as Jews, gypsies (tatere) and Poles.\n\n     The wanderer's violent outburst at the kitten--and the death of the kitten--is out of line with the actual offense. While the death of the kitten does not impact the economy of the farm in a meaningful way (perhaps there will be a few more mice running about), the extraordinary violence of the outburst does pose a threat. Indeed, if he could kill a cute, furry little kitty cat, imagine what he could do to a child. The outburst links the wanderer to other outsiders, including supernatural outsiders such as the nisse, whose reactions also tend to be disproportionate. The reference to his size--\"almost like a giant\"--and his strange speech solidify this link.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en ham kunde min Oldefader hu-\nske, h. gik altid n\u00f8gen undtagen paa Bry\nog Ryg, der havde h. et Faareskind.
