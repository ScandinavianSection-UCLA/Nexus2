In variant A, to which Jens's verse alludes, a young man is initiated into sex by an old hag. When he tries to rid himself of her by approaching the bishop, she reveals herself to be a shape shifter, ultimately turning into a werewolf whose private parts are torn out by a fence pole. In variant B, a young man marries a hag who turns out to be a witch, a surmise made explicit in a verse sung by a child at Lime school (DSkv 4). Ultimately, the young man runs an old rusty knife up into her behind, loosing a torrent of devils. In variant C, a farmhand has an affair with what he thinks is a young girl, but she turns out to be a hag--in this case, a mound woman, recognizable by her oven rake and peel-board. \n\n      It is not hard to imagine that Jens is playing somewhat with the earnest folklore collector. While he takes his ballad singing quite seriously, he also has a broad repertoire that includes obscene and amusing songs. Not surprisingly, the fragment does not appear in DgF, although Grundtvig proposes certain similarities between the ballad and DgF 115, \"Dansk Kongetal\" [Danish Kings]. The main similarity concerns the hag of whom one cannot rid oneself.", "danish_manuscript": "Kj\u00e6llingen sig til en W\u00e5rulv mon skav'\ni Skoven s. monne hun tonte\ns. sprang hun over de tv\u00e6re Gjar\nder r\u00f8v hun ud hende Kondte\n-------------------------------------\n[Det h\u00e6ndte sig for gangen Aften\nforsildig]\n", "english_manuscript": "The bitch turned herself into a werewolf\nand she ran off into the woods;\nshe jumped over the two fences\nand there she tore out her cunt\n----\n[It happened really late the other night]", "danish_publication": "Kj\u00e6llingen sig til en w\u00e5\u00e5rulv mon skab',\ni skoven s\u00e5 monne hun tondte:\ns\u00e5 sprang hun over de tw\u00e6re gjaar,\nder r\u00f6v hun ud hende k..dte.", "english_publication": "The bitch turned herself into a werewolf\nand she ran off into the woods;\nshe jumped over the two fences\nand there she tore out her c.nt\n", "keywords": {"keyword": ["fence", "werewolf", "woods"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Dansk Skj\u00e6mteviser", "heading_english": "Danish Jocular Ballads"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
