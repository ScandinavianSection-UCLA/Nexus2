The night raven is closely related to haunts (DS  II C 104 and II C 112), and in particular, the haunts of suicides (DS II C 106). In Peder's story, there is no indication that the raven had at one point been a human. In Danske sagn, the story is situated somewhat unusually in a section with stories about a giant bird that kills a bull, a story best known from the collections of Ole Worm (DS II C 118).\n\n    The motif of ravens participating in battle might be linked to Nordic mythology (Sk\u00e1ldskapam\u00e1l 60), which had been made broadly available to the Danish rural populace in large part through the efforts of NFS Grundtvig, and the h\u00f8jskole movement. \n\n     Svend Grundtvig proposes that the word valravn is related to the word varulv or werewolf, since in his interpretation, the valravn is a person who assumes the shape of a raven (DgF II, 480). This interpretation of the valravn derives from the ballad tradition, but does not align with Peder's description here. Rather, Peder's description aligns better with one of the etymologies that Grundtvig discards, namely the Old Icelandic word valr, which means \"the slain in battle\" (the name of Odin's hall, Valh\u00f6ll, hall of the battle slain, derives from valr, and offers an analogous example of compound formation with the stem val-).\n\n     The valravn appears in Danish ballad tradition (see in particular DgF 60; also DgF 61 and 62). The ballad was included in Vedel's collection and was also popular as a broadsheet (DgF II, 479). Oehlenschl\u00e4ger also wrote a poem, Valravnen (1803), that was based on the ballad German Gladesvend (DgF 33). Given Peder's description of the creature, it is unlikely that he was aware of the ballad or Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's poem.", "danish_manuscript": "Wolravne de blev af, naar de i Slaget ikke\nfik Kongen eller H\u00f8vdingen funden og begravet\nog der saa kom Ravne og aad af ham, de blev \ntil V. og den der aad hans Hj\u00e6rte den fik\nMskeforstand og kunde gj\u00f8re ondt og forvende\nMsker og var nogle skr\u00e6kk.
