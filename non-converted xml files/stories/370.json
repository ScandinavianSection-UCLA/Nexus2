Although the tale has an implicit conclusion, namely the wedding of the girl and the bewitched tom cat (probably a prince given that his parents live in a castle), the tale is missing almost all of the development of characters and plot characteristics of her other fairy tales. Holbek would classify this tale as one with an active feminine heroine, given the role of the young girl in the tale and the bewitched nature of the prince (Holbek 1987, 433). It is most likely that Tang Kristensen asked if she knew anything else, perhaps another fairy tale or ballad, and this is what she could remember.", "danish_manuscript": "En Kone havde skabt ham i en Havkat\nH. gik i Skoven.
