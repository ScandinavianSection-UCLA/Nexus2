S\u00e5 fort\u00e6ller han om hans kusk, at han var s\u00e5 st\u00e6rk, te aldrig nogen kunde l\u00e6gge ham til jorden. S\u00e5 siger greven, at der var en af hans gods, som han havde tro til kunde gj\u00f8re det. Det slog de nu et stort v\u00e6ddem\u00e5l om. Uden videre kom der bud efter Kristen S\u00f8, og han kom strags. Greven spurgte, om han vilde tjene hans rest (restance med landgilde) i dag. Ja, den kunde han vel ikke tjene i dag, for han var omtrent en 70 daler \u00e6bag. Jo, s\u00e5dan og s\u00e5dan var det, og kunde han l\u00e6gge kusken til jorden, var hans rest ham eftergivet, men hvis ikke, skulde han betale om en m\u00e5ned. Ja, s\u00e5 vilde han se, hvad han kunde. De kommer nu ud i borgg\u00e5rden, og der f\u00e5r de tag p\u00e5 hinanden. Der var ikke stenpikket, og det f\u00f6rste tag, de tog, der bryder Kj\u00f6benhavneren ham p\u00e5 det ene kn\u00e6. Men s\u00e5 stod han op med det samme og kylte kusken fra sig, ligesom n\u00e5r de kyler en dreng. S\u00e5 sp\u00f6rger han, om de skulde pr\u00f8ve igjen. Nej, kusken br\u00f8d sig ikke om det mere. S\u00e5 sp\u00f6rger greven ham om, hvordan det var, han lod sig bryde \u00e5 det ene kn\u00e6. Det skulde han sige dem. Han havde haft fat i mange, men han var aldrig vant til at bruge uden det halve af hans styrke, siden s\u00e5 det hele. Men her var den bedste, han havde haft ved l\u00e6nge, og s\u00e5 matte han til at tage ved det hele. Greven han vandt jo v\u00e6ddem\u00e5let, og Kristen S\u00f8 blev hans restancer givet efter.\nGreven havde en ridehest, de ikke kunde f\u00e5 bagskoet, og der skulde s\u00e5 bud, du v\u00e9d, efter denher Kristen S\u00f8. S\u00e5 siger greven, om han kunde holde den hest op, mens smeden skoede den. Jo, men han vilde ikke svare til, om hesten tog nogen skade. Det gjorde ikke noget, sagde greven, den var betalt, han kom selv til at tage tabet. N\u00e5, han holder, og smeden lagde skoen under, men da han slap, var l\u00e5ret rykket af, hesten kunde hverken st\u00f8de eller st\u00e5.\n     Hovfolkene de havde jo s\u00e5dan sl\u00e6tgilder, og de skulde have deres visse t\u00f8nder \u00f8l at drikke. S\u00e5 havde de bud oppe, om de kunde f\u00e5 mere. Ja, de kunde f\u00e5 det, en mand kunde b\u00e6re. S\u00e5 var de jo lige s\u00e5 kloge som s\u00e5, de f\u00e5r Kristen S\u00f8 af sted. Han tager et fjerrild under hver arm og en halv t\u00f8nde i hver h\u00e5nd s\u00e5dan i spundet, og s\u00e5 havde de nok til deres gilde for det s\u00e6t.\n     Kristen S\u00f8 havde s\u00e5dan et par k\u00f8er, og en dag havde han en til at kj\u00f8re hans m\u00f8g ud. Den fremmede mand sagde til ham, at han m\u00e5tte ikke l\u00e6gge s\u00e5 meget p\u00e5, for hans b\u00e6ster kunde ikke tage det af m\u00f8nghullet \u2014 det har kanske v\u00e6ret et slemt dybt hul. Ja, n\u00e5r der ikke var andet ved det, s\u00e5 kunde han selv tr\u00e6kke det af.

Then he tells him about his coachman, that he was so strong that no one could knock him to the ground. Then the count says that there was someone on his manor that he believed could do it. Now they made a big bet about it. Kristen S\u00f8 was sent for without delay and he came immediately. The count asked if he wanted to earn his outstanding debt today. Well, he didn\u2019t think he could earn it today because he was about seventy rixdollars in arrears. Well, it was like this and that, and if he could lay the driver to the ground, his debt was forgiven but, if not, he had to pay within the month. Well, he\u2019d see what he could do. They go out into the castle courtyard, and they grab hold of one another. It wasn\u2019t cobblestone there, and with the first grasp, the one from Copenhagen gets Kristen down on one knee. But then Kristen stood up and immediately tossed the coachman away, just as when you toss a boy. Then he asked him if wanted to try again. No, the coachman didn\u2019t want to do that any more. Then the count asks Kristen how it was that he let him force him down on one knee. He\u2019d tell him. He\u2019d gotten into it with a lot of others, but he had never had to use more than half of his strength, and certainly never all of it. But here was the best one he\u2019d encountered in a long time, and so he had to use all his strength. The count won the bet, and Kristen\u2019s debt was forgiven. The count had a riding horse, they couldn\u2019t shoe it, and so they sent for, you know, this guy Kristen S\u00f8. The count asks him if he can hold the horse up while the smith shod it. Sure, but he couldn\u2019t be responsible if the horse got hurt. That didn't matter, said the count, it was paid for, he\u2019d take the loss himself. Well, he holds and the smith shod it, but when he let go, the horse's one thigh had gone out of joint, and the horse could neither kick nor stand.\n     The villeinage folk they had their parties out on the fields, and they were supposed to have a certain number of kegs of beer to drink. They sent a message up and asked if they could have more. Yes, they could have as much as a man could carry. Well, they were pretty smart, so they send Kristen S\u00f8 off to get it. He takes a cask under each arm, and a half barrel in each hand, and then they had plenty for their party. \n     Kristen S\u00f8 had a couple of cows, and one day he had someone drive his dung out to the fields. This man said that he shouldn\u2019t put too much on the wagon, because his horses couldn\u2019t pull it all out of the dung pool\u2014it was apparently a very deep hole. Well, if there was nothing else to do about that, then Kristen said that he could pull it out himself. And he did that too each time, and the man would harness his horses up at the top of the hole.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["arms", "barrel", "beer", "belief", "bet", "boy", "cask", "castle", "cobbler", "count", "courtyard", "cow", "day", "debt", "drinking", "driver", "dung", "field", "folk", "harness", "horse", "keg", "knee", "Kristen", "Kristen S\u00f8", "manor", "message", "month", "party", "riding", "shoe", "smart", "smithing", "strength", "thigh", "today", "villeinage", "wagon"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Fra hoveriets tid", "heading_english": "From the time of villeinage"}, "tango_indices": null}
