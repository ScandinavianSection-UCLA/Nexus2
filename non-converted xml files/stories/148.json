Ghosts in the cemetery need to be conjured back into the ground, as they threaten to disrupt the world of the living. In a Lutheran accommodation of folk belief surrounding ghosts, ghosts were linked to manifestations of Satan (Tangherlini 1998). There could hardly be a more threatening figure than Satan in a Lutheran community, and one of the most common strategies for dealing with him was to call for the minister (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n     Kathleen Stokker links this story to questions about the power of the minister, confession and salvation, focusing particularly on the \"Black Book minister\" of Norwegian tradition (Stokker 1992). She proposes that the minister is essentially powerless to stop the farmhand from sinking, and resorts to confession and extreme unction to at least guarantee the young man salvation. An alternate reading of these stories is less supportive of the minister: if he is powerful enough to conjure the young man, he should be powerful enough to unconjure him as it were. Instead, he continues with the conjuring--and effective burial--as a form of extreme punishment.\n\n      The resolution of this story is stark--the farmhand is dead and the minister's wife has gone mad. So, while the farmhand intended only to restore the minister to the parsonage (and his wife) at night where under all other circumstances he rightfully belonged, his actions lead to a horrific dissolution of the minister's family.", "danish_manuscript": "En pr\u00e6st i Mosbj\u00e6rg skulde op paa Kirke-\ngaarden 1 Time hver eneste Aften.
