His motivation for doing so is missing in Margrete's variant. One also needs to interpolate a missing conversation between the boy and the mound dweller to understand the seemingly obscure reference to Tordenf\u00e5er (Thunder father) and M\u00fctter Maria (mother Mary). In other variants of this legend, the boy has either gone out to ask the mound dweller to stand as godfather for the farmer's child--an interesting reversal of the mound dweller asking a farmer's wife to act as midwife to his wife--or to trick the mound dweller into giving a large monetary gift to celebrate the birth of the child--again, a parallel to the midwife legends (DS I 1414). In other variants of this legend, the mound dweller provides a substantial monetary gift, but begs off attending the celebration because the guests will include religious figures (the mother Mary, and in most cases the Lord and St. Peter), and the music will be drumming (referred to in this case as \"Tordenf\u00e5er\" (Thunder father) by the mound man) (DS I 1413). \n\n     The mound dweller apparently assists the hired hand in his work in this story, and thus takes on some aspects of the helpful nisse. Like a nisse, the mound dweller guarantees success for the farm, but also shows a distinct loyalty to the farmhand and the farm. The legend affirms the strong economic connection between the farmers and supernatural beings that informs many of Margrete's legends.", "danish_manuscript": "S. r\u00e6d for Tordenf\u00e5r og Mutter Maria.\nGod dag.
