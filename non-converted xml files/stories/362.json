All of the components of the process rely on inversions of the normal order, all ultimately for personal gain. \n\n     Thursdays appear frequently as a liminal day, the last day of the week that is not charged with any religious significance (Friday was traditionally a day of fasting in preparation for the Sabbath, although such practice was in decline already from the beginning of the Reformation). Peat, a common fuel for heating, is not supposed to be dug at midnight. In fact no activity is supposed to take place at this late hour outside the farm at all, and certainly not in the middle of an intersection, where it would disrupt traffic. The intersection forms a cross, and thus should have religious power, but here it is used in a non-religious, or perhaps even anti-religious fashion. Toads are generally seen as connected to Satan and witches, even though they can also be considered good luck omens. Toads figure prominently as ingredients in various magical potions, as is the case here. Attending church at midnight and blowing through the keyhole are two common ways to come into contact with Satan. \n\n     The genie resonates with Margrete's folktale about the genie in the bottle (AMJ 2.02), although in this story the genie has a more ominous origin, and does not derive from a normal, albeit somewhat questionable, economic transaction. \n\n     Oddly, the published version does not include the motif of burying the toad in the peat stack.", "danish_manuscript": "Naar de gik til en Korsvej kl. 12 3 tors\ndag aftener og grave en T\u00f8rv, s. skulde der\nkomme en Skruptusse og den skulde de tage\n[dem] og grave [den] ned der, under, den T\u00f8rv\nfinde den.
