A road went through the woods and they had strung up a rope with bells on it so they could hear when somebody came by. They had made a pact with the devil and he was supposed to teach them what they needed to do so they could fly. They had to get hold of a pregnant woman and cut the child out of her, and if it was a male child, they were supposed to take its heart and eat it, then they could fly. So they killed thirteen women, but there were girls in all of them, and they didn\u2019t get much out of that. Finally there was a man who was called Store-Johan (Big Johan) who was in cahoots with them and he sold them his wife. They tied her stark-naked to a tree and were going to cut into her. But at that moment some riflemen from a manor farm came riding by and they chased them away and then the robbers and the man were caught. The woman died and it turned out that she was carrying two boys, but now they didn\u2019t get anything out of that.
