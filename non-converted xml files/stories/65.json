In this widely attested story, a deaf mute reacts incongruously to the death of two people (DS II G 266). Whereas in other stories like this one, the devil and angels appear to carry off the soul of the deceased, here the dove represents an ascension into heaven, and the raven a descent into hell. The story relies on the inability of the deaf mute to explain his response. Jens carefully adds that the coachman had not learned sign language. The minister, puzzled by the incongruity of the coachman's reactions, prays and his coachman's speech is miraculously restored.\n\n     Jens's coda, insisting on the truth of the account, is uncharacteristic for him. It may suggest that he doubted many of the other stories he told. Or it may indicate that the account is to him so unbelievable that he has to narratively counteract that, by emphasizing its truth.\n\n     Sign language first made in roads in Denmark when Dr. P. A. Castberg opened his school for the deaf in 1807. By the 1880s, sign language was no longer the preferred method of teaching the deaf in Denmark; instead, the goal was to have the deaf learn to speak. It is unlikely that the development of education for the deaf influences Jens's story in any way.", "danish_manuscript": "Kirketorup Pr\u00e6st h. havde en dum Kusk.\nS. kj\u00f8rte de en Gang og skulde til Bislev og \nKusken kunde jo ingen Ting sige og havde\nikke l\u00e6rt nogen Ting af Fingersprog ell.\nslige Ting saadan som nu.
