These capabilities certainly qualify the minister as a wise minister and align him with other wise ministers that figure prominently in Jens Peter's repertoire (JPP 1.07-09). Pastor Trap's apparent wealth and power is unusual for a local minister; Jens Peter connects this to Trap's alleged membership in the Freemasons. There are numerous stories about the Freemasons, describing them as having access to untold wealth (DS VI 48), but also indicating that they have a pact with the devil (DS VI 66).\n\n     The first Freemason organization in Denmark started in Copenhagen in 1743. This was modeled after the British Freemasonry that emerged in London in 1717. Danish Freemasonry was organized according to both German and British precedent through the first part of the nineteenth century. King Frederik VII was instrumental in changing the organization of the Danish lodge to the Swedish system of Freemasonry in 1858. Interestingly, Peder Johansen's boss at the mill in Fuldbro was a member of the masons (see biographical essay on Peder Johansen); despite this (or perhaps because of this), Peder did not tell any stories of the alleged supernatural abilities of masons.\n\n     Tang Kristensen collected other variants of this story that also included Pastor Trap's ability to foresee the date of his death (DS VI 68). Erik Jessen Trap was the owner of Hvidstedg\u00e5rd from 1782-1804, and the parish minister in T\u00e5rs.
