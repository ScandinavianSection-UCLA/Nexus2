The two men, out late at night, are interested in getting home quickly, and so they borrow a convenient horse. Unfortunately, in a widely attested motif, the horse is actually the devil. Not surprisingly, hitching a ride on the devil's back turns dangerous, with riders either carried high into the sky (DS II D 109), or tossed into rivers or lakes (DS II D 99). In the latter case, it is usually young girls on their way home at night from a knitting room who climb the horse to ford a stream (DS II D 73). \n\n     In almost all cases, the horse is taken without permission. Generally, the horse is easy to catch, tempting the rider(s) to steal it. The resolution often mentions that the rider changes his or her behavior, suffers physically from the ride, or is marked for life from the encounter.\n\n     Riding the easily caught horse with disastrous consequences is reminiscent of Einar's ill-advised riding of Freyfaxi in Hrafnkels saga (J\u00f3n 1950). In that saga, Einar rides a horse that he has been expressly forbidden from riding and, as a result, he is executed. The punishment for stealing horses in nineteenth century Denmark was less extreme, although the Danish Law defined the theft of a farmer's horse as h\u00e6rv\u00e6rk (vandalism); the perpetrator would be fined and forced to pay compensation. \n\n     There is some confusion over the Captain's name. At the beginning of the recording (JPP 4.21), Tang Kristensen writes the name as Skj\u00e6rul, but later in the manuscript, he uses the spelling Skj\u00e6rulf. Although there is no division between this story and the preceding in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen splits the stories in his published versions and, because of this split, he adds some things, such as the reference to Linderumg\u00e5rd in the first line, and deletes other things, such as the narrative connector, \"Right after that...\"", "danish_manuscript": "Knap efter kom dh.
