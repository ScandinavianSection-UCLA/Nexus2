In all likelihood, Kirsten Marie was trying to remember another story, and could only recall bits and pieces of the tale. Another possibility is that Kirsten Marie had remembered this detail, which was to be included in one of the tales that she had just told him. The registration of the fragment as \u00c6v 1511b (Brandt 1974) suggests that it was to be incorporated into \u00c6v 1511 (KMP 1.49), but it is unclear where the fragment would fit in that story. A final possibility is that Tang Kristensen felt he knew the tale so well that he only had to record this small fragment and that he could reconstitute the tale later.", "danish_manuscript": "Hun skulde lave Mad til Kongen.
