There are other stories that attest to a witch named Rut traveling in the shape of a hare (DS VII 119).\n\n     In this story, the witch is closely related to the large landholding class, working in the direct service of the aristocrat. The connection between large estates and the devil (and his servants) is also widely attested. The story has an interesting resonance with Jens Peter's story of the young witch whom the chamberlain and the minister discover (JPP 4.08). In that story, instead of employing her for their own gain, they re-baptize her and restore her to the community. Such is not the case in this story; instead, the elderly shepherdess is forced to run errands for the wealthy land owner. Clearly, the rich do not have the best interests of the poor at heart.", "danish_manuscript": "For en 80 Aar siden gik en lille\nKone og var Faarhj\u00f8rde paa B\u00f8g\nsted.
