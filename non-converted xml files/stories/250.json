The story seemingly contradicts Kirsten Marie's previous stories, since the low status entertainer is narratively lauded, while the land holders are shown to be quite stupid. At the same time, her story seemingly supports the general sense that lower status people are untrustworthy. \n\n      There are two important reversals that animate this story. First, the victims of the scam are large land holders. Consequently, the narrative is not directed at Kirsten Marie's cohort, but rather at a class with whom the farmers often fought and who, during the years after the initial constitutional reforms of 1848, showed themselves time and again not to be on the side of the small farmer. Presumably, the new manor lord at \u00c6bletoft, because of his modest beginnings, would have much more in common with the local farmers. Second, the man uses the legal system that had formerly been firmly in the hands of the manor lords in the form of the birk (judicial districts) to defeat them. Accordingly, the story explores the penetration of litigation into all levels of rural culture. \n\n     Bogensholm is now used as a children's camp.", "danish_manuscript": "Der er en lille Herregrd ved Ebeltoft der kal\ndes Bovnsholm, der var en Mand der hed\nGreve Niels h. var fra Ebeltoft og h var som\nBajads ved et Selskab der, indbuden som\nNar der.
