Supernatural threats to churches can also be read as threats to the community. The serpent that encircles the church prevents the people from using the church as a place to gather and to worship. Such an inversion of the normal social order is best counteracted by another inversion. Accordingly, the villagers raise a bull on food that makes little sense for a bull to eat.
