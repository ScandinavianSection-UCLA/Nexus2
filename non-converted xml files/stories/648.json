There had been a storm for several days, but then the weather got better. Two men from Dollerup wanted to go to the beach to scavenge, and there they found the remains of a deck house in which there was a well-dressed man. They wanted to kill him at first, but he begged them to let him live and bring him to the minister. They take him and lead him to Sj\u00f8rring church and get there just as the minister and the congregation were coming out of the church. The minister now blesses him and immediately afterward the man dies. The flesh falls from his bones and most of the people who were present get sick and die. But before he died, he explained that he was a bishop from Antwerp and was going to B\u00f8rglum parish to be bishop. But he didn\u2019t get there, now his grave was to be in Sj\u00f8rring. The two men who carried him there survived the plague. For twelve or thirteen months a fog lay over the area and during that time the plague raged.
