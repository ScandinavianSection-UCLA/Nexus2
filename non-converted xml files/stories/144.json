The humor in the story relies on the obvious disconnect between the minister's description of the actions of a runaway cow, and the mourners' impression that he is describing the journey of the soul of the dearly departed. The punch line plays on the expression, \"nu rejser hun ad helvede til,\" which can mean literally, \"Now she journey's off to hell\" or, more figuratively and descriptively, \"Now she takes off running like hellfire.\" The word \"kirkegaard\" literally means churchyard but, as all Danish churches are surrounded by their cemeteries, it can also be translated as cemetery.", "danish_manuscript": "Pr. der kaster Jord paa: 1.
