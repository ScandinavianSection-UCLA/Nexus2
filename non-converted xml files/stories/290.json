There were also debates over the care for pregnant wanderers such as the woman in this story. Many small communities expressed a concern that the care for poor wanderers (foreign poor) and their children would place an undue burden on local farmers (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).\n\n     The apparent wealth of the gypsies, who were clearly neither local nor poor, reflects the growing concern of a free rider problem in poverty assistance programs. The party the gypsies throw is further characterized as an ungodly affair, with dancing and gambling, both seen as vices by more conservative Danish Lutherans. Gambling was frequently mentioned in debates over legislation concerning support for the poor as one of the causes for a poverty that an individual had brought upon themselves. \n\n     Stories such as this no doubt supported the belief that some of the people who passed themselves off as poor were gaming the system. This belief led to some fairly stringent laws concerning repayment of support and limitations of the civil rights of the poor (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).", "danish_manuscript": "Deher Tatere gik jo omkring i gl.
