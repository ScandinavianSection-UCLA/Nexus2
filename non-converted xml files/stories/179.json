It is worth noting that the chamberlain has the girl milk a cotter's cow to death, and not one of his own. \n\n     The girl is young enough not to be a full blown witch, and re-baptizing her proves efficacious against her budding relationship with Satan. Other stories describe young girls being initiated into witchcraft by older mentors (DS VII 527). These initiations always remove the young girls from the broader community. Re-baptism, conversely, allowed the neophyte witch to be accepted back into the community. In this story, the girl returns to her community as innocent as when she was born--and accordingly is transformed back into an infant. Jens Peter makes no mention of whether the girl later regained her faculties.\n\n     Jens Peter's coda provides an interesting insight into naming conventions in rural Denmark. Nicknames often referred to local places or houses. At the end of the century, it became more common for people to seek permission to change family names from patronymics to more individualized names, such as place names. In 1828, Frederik VI promulgated a baptismal order that required standardized and persistent family names (in favor of the earlier use of patronymics). By 1903, people who wanted to use place names as family names had to prove a clear relationship to that area.\n\n     B\u00f8rglum monastery was originally a royal landholding. Knud the Holy was driven from B\u00f8rglum when the Vendels rose up in 1086. In 1128, the holdings were given to the Cistercians, and B\u00f8rglum monastery became the See for the surrounding area. After the Reformation in 1536, B\u00f8rglum was reclaimed by the Crown and offered to various aristocrats as a len (fief). It was still used as the Bishopric until 1554, when Laurits Nilsson moved the Bishopric to \u00c5lborg. In 1623, B\u00f8rglum became part of Sor\u00f8 Academy, a school for young aristocrats. After the dissolution of the academy in 1669, it became an independent holding. The current Sor\u00f8 Academy is on Sj\u00e6lland, at another former Cistercian monastery. The reference to Chamberlain Hiller\u00f8d must be to Niels Friderichsen Hillerup (d. 1819), who acquired B\u00f8rglum in 1802 and also owned Vrejlev monastery.", "danish_manuscript": "[H. kunde] Kammerherre Hiller\u00f8d paa\nB\u00f8rglumkloster.
