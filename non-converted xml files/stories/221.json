Instead, it relies on several key concepts in Danish folklore for its reportability. The concept of the outsider is addressed in the unusual gate that the manor lord and lady are forced to drive through, associating the island of Funen in a peculiar way with the conceptual category \"outside,\" as the whale bone gates and the seemingly windowless house indicate otherness. Class differences are apparent on two levels: the story is reported not by the manor lord or lady, but rather by their servant, the coachman. His attitude toward the mistress in particular may be read in the reported direct speech of the mistress on seeing the condition of the house. She is pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the farmer's wife, a form of narrative criticism in that the upper class discovers that the lower farming class (to which Kirsten Marie belonged) was perhaps not as \"below\" the aristocracy as they would have it. The privy councilor and the lady are also brought down a social notch in the short exchange between them. Not surprisingly, it is the coachman who makes sure that they are well-quartered for the night. The lady's expression--Bong wahrhaftig--is not commented on by Tang Kristensen nor is it glossed by Feilberg. The unusual nature of the expression serves to further set apart--and ridicule--the lady.  Klavsholm (Clausholm) is the same castle that Ane Margrete Jensdatter mentions in the conclusion of one of her ballads (AMJ 1.02 and 4.02).", "danish_manuscript": "Kusken paa Klavsholm kj\u00f8rte en g. med Her-\nskabet ovre paa Fyn gjennem Vissenbj\u00f8rg Gy-\nde.
