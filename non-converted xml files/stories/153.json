The essential features are the same: a person, carrying a large sum of money, is attacked by robbers in the hills. By his own quick action and strength, or through the intervention of a person with training in fighting (be it a huntsman or a soldier), the attack is averted and the robbers are punished.", "danish_manuscript": "En Man paa Spangerhede der hed F\u00e6rch\nh. solgte en Hest til Aalborg for 600 Rdl.\n\n6292B\nS. tjente en Karl der som Kusk h. hed\nJens Snaarup og h. havde v\u00e6ret Dra\ngon i Randers og vant til at ride og\ns. red h. med Hesten ved Haanden og\nred paa en Dragonhest.
