Even though the practice was banned because of the significant damage that the animals did to the fields, the ban was hard to enforce. As the parceling of fields was completed, more substantial fences and walls were erected, and more consistent techniques in fertilizing, drainage, and crop rotation were implemented. Ultimately, the practice of uncontrolled grazing was abandoned.\n\n     The story plays on the stereotype of the foolish Molbo. Tang Kristensen published several volumes of these stories, inspired in part by Tuxen's earlier collection of similar stories (1866). \n\n     In this and the following story, Tang Kristensen tried to capture Kirsten Marie's use of dialect. Hajjbj\u00f6re is a dialect pronunciation of Hadbjerg, a location that strictly speaking does not geographically qualify as Mols. Instead, it is the foolish actions of the protagonist that prompt Tang Kristensen to classify the story as a Molbo tale.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand der har [slaaet]\n--\nDe wa i di tier te B\u00f8sterne gik [l\u00f8\u00f8s] om \u00e6ter\noren i marken, s\u00e5 wa d\u00e6 en mand i Hajj\nbj\u00f8rre d\u00e6 r\u00e6j ud \u00e5 [lee] leje om hans b\u00e6ster\nom muenen \u00e5 vild si huen di wa. # Han\nha sat jet i st\u00e5len om awtenen, f\u00e5 de\nhan vil ha et \u00e5 ri opo om muenen\nnoe han skul u \u00e5 leje om de ande\n\u00e5 s\u00e5 to han de \u00e5 [sa] sat s\u00e6 \u00e5p \u00e5 re opo\nDa han no kam ud i marken, s\u00e5 ku\nhan s. \u00e5l hans b\u00e6ste undtaawen de gro\nS\u00e5 kam han te en inan \u00e5 ham spu ham\nom h. ku it s\u00e6j ham hue de gro \u00f8eg\nwa, han ku si \u00e5llde di ande, men di\nku han it si.
