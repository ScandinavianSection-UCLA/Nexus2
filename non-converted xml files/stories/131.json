The girl's use of the witch's butter should be understood in the context of stories about the witch's milking and their theft from the community. The girl uses both contagious and sympathetic magic to inflict her curse. In other variants, \"heksefedt\" [witch's fat] is used to inflict the curse (DS VII 296); cunning folk are often called to counteract the effects of the curse. Jens Ilder counters the curse with the rifle shot, and the girl eventually submits to his request, in exchange for being cured. \n\n     Most witches who are shot are in the shape of a hare. The witch usually suffers a broken arm or leg (DS VII 268), and the cunning person does not offer to cure them. In this story, Jens Ilder seems to take into consideration that the girl does not herself appear to be a witch.\n\n     St. Hans eve is widely attested as the time when the witches ride to their Sabbath. There does not seem to be consensus in tradition concerning the specific day on which witches churn their butter.", "danish_manuscript": "Hegsene de kj\u00e6rnede [s] S Hans aften.
