The Christmas celebrations and similar lejestuer [festive celebrations] held at various farms were one of the few chances for unmarried men and women of the parish to gather in an informal and non-work setting.\n\nTang Kristensen has written a long introduction to this record:\n\nFollowing here are certain formula that have been used at Christmas gatherings, and are deliberate twisting of expressions. While they appear to make fun of the holy word, they should rather be considered examples of youthful self confidence and enthusiasm. Several of these formula also have obscene or vulgar sections. In earlier times people didn't take this as seriously, and it often happened that, if such sentences were presented in a jocular manner, they could lead to great amusement. In particular, they would perform marriages and baptisms, imitating, using other words, church functions, into which they would infuse amusement. Twisted invitations to births or weddings were also common at these occasions and, since I have a large number of them at hand, and since there is now occasion to give some examples, they follow here as well. One should note that many of them, perhaps because of later misunderstandings, have been woven into other nonsense rhymes, so all of it has in fact become nonsense now. I refer to my book, Molbo- og Aggerbohistorier, the section on Lying Nonsense (MA I, 108-120, MA II, 112-126).", "danish_manuscript": "No field diary recording", "english_manuscript": "Wedding vows: Just as the hoopoe with its beautiful crown or the peacock with its gilded feathers and spotted legs, that is exactly how your hastily dolled up bride and groom appear to me today.

Adskillige af disse formularer havde endog us\u00f8mmelige eller platte afsnit. I forrige tider tog man det ikke s\u00e5 n\u00f6je hermed, og det var ikke fri, at slige s\u00e6tninger, n\u00e5r de blev vittigt fremsatte, vakte den st\u00f6rste morskab. S\u00e6rlig brugte man at \u00e6gtevie og at d\u00f8be, efterlignede alts\u00e5 de kirkelige handlinger, hvortil der kunde knyttes munterhed. Forvr\u00e6ngede indbydelser til barsel og bryllup bragtes ogs\u00e5 ved samme lejlighed, og da jeg har en stor masse af dem liggende, og der her er anledning til at give pr\u00f8ver af dem, f\u00f8lger de med.

Men jeg frygter for, at han skal komme til at sige, ligesom Moses siger i det 5. bagvendt i det 28.: \"Du skal trolove dig en hustru, men andre skal sove hos hende.\" Det er textens ord.\nS\u00e5 tilsp\u00f6rger jeg dig, du \u00e6rel\u00f8se og velforagtede ungkarl Mikkel Husl\u00f8s, om du har ber\u00e5dt dig med din sl\u00e6gt og venner ligesom tolderen i Viborg eller overbetjenten i Aalborg, om du vil have den \u00e6rel\u00f8se og velforagtede ungpige Sidsel Sluwp... som st\u00e5r ved din side?
