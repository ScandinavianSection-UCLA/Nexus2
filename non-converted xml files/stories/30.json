Finally they decided to turn the shoes on their horses, with the heels toward the front. The robbers didn't dare go home now that they'd blown up Stubberuphus. But now they could see that they'd ridden away from there, and so they rode quickly in and then they were shot. Around Egholm and Stubberup there were big moats. When Mylius got hold of these farms, he included in the papers a clause that allowed him to take possession of any of their property that hindered him. Then he took the meadows and gave them heath instead. The old copyholders also had permission to graze their animals in the woods, but he forbade them that as well. The woods were to be fenced in. When the old copyholders had died off, he took all the meadows from them, and then he dug drainage ditches and irrigated them.
