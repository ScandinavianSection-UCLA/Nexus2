Many of Jens's other stories probe the thin line separating witchcraft and cunning. But cursing people and, in this instance, presumably cursing their animals, would certainly qualify as malicious under the ordinances of the Danish Law of 1683. It is not surprising, then, that the man in Gandrup is in league with the devil. As in most stories that include a pact with the devil, the devil always try to collect, with gruesome results. \n\n     The use of a horse's head to prevent the witching is an unusual remedy, although it might be that using a horse's head in some way mimicked the outcome of the curse--an example of inverse sympathetic magic. Rye bread as a prophylaxis against the devil is not widely attested and somewhat difficult to decipher. \n\n     Tang Kristensen made several inexplicable changes to the manuscript that suggest that the man had bewitched the farm where he lived--a detail that is not in the manuscript, and changes the locus of threat from the outside community to inside the house itself.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en M. der ude i Gandrup.
