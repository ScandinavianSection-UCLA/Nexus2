The hired girl, who lets her curiosity get the better of her, may implicitly have a hand in the failure, since other legends attest to the ruinous consequences of people witnessing interactions between wise ministers or cunning folk and the Devil (JPP 2.15). At the same time, the girl's curiosity makes the first hand narrative possible. The outcome of the encounter--the boy's death--seems to be included almost as an afterthought. The interaction between Yww Luet and the Devil is reminiscent of the interaction between the Bragholt Hag, a cunning woman, and the Devil in a story told by Jens Peter Pedersen (JPP 2.07).\n\n     Yww Luet-or Ivar Laust-is not mentioned in R\u00f8rbye's study of cunning folk (R\u00f8rbye 1976). The use of the term \"hekse-mester\" [witch master] should be seen as an ideological evaluation of Ivar Laust's abilities, ascribing him the status of witch as opposed to that of cunning man, the term used at the start of the story (when there was still hope for a cure).\n\n     This story is neither found in the diaries nor in the fair copy collection.
