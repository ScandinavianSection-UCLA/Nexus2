Among the reforms that came with the constitution in 1849 was a prohibition on the use of corporal punishment on tenants. \n\n     In this story, the capricious nature of Speitzer's punishments and the harsh demands of villeinage lead to the peasants' assault on him. Unlike other stories of cruel manor lords, the punishment in Jens's story does not take a supernatural form, such as being carried away by the devil  (JPP 2.05), a motif that does appear in other variants describing Speitzer's death (JAH II 254). Instead, the punishment is utterly of this world and verges on being a small scale peasant revolt. The story of Speitzer's beating is also mentioned in other stories (JAH II 254 and 255), and in their description, they emphasize that the assailants crushed Speitzer's right hand between two stones. \n\n     Jens's story about Speitzer is more elaborate than many other variants. He expands the story to include the apparent escape of at least one of the assailants. The little child nearly reveals the hiding place of the hidden assailant, but the child's speech is confusing enough that the scouts do not discover him. Hiding the assailant suggests a conspiracy among the peasants to protect their own against a fundamentally unjust system. The unjustness of the manor farm system, of course, lay at the root of the constitutional reforms of 1849; this story stands in part as one about the \"bad old days,\" and the resourcefulness of the peasants in the face of that system.\n\n     In the second part of the story, Jens returns his focus to Speitzer, and relates another incident that emphasizes Speitzer's arrogance and his cruelty. His refusal to confess to the minister underscores his unwillingness to be part of the (human) community. The lecherous manor lord is a motif found in other stories of cruel manor lords as well (PJ 2.01).\n\n     Other stories suggest that Speitzer owned Aggersborgg\u00e5rd, V\u00e5r and \u00d8rndrup. These three large holdings form a triangle with Aggersborgg\u00e5rd in the northwest, V\u00e5r twelve kilometers to the east, and \u00d8rndrup seventeen kilometers to the south. \u00d8rndrup is approximately twenty-four kilometers west of Ersted. When Speitzer offers one of the farms to Per Skytte, it is implicit that it is one of these three farms. Early records indicate that the Speitzer family owned Aggersborgg\u00e5rd during that period, and that Mads Speitzer was the oldest son of Christen Madsen Speitzer (d. 2.5.1767) and Anna Margrethe Lund. Tang Kristensen normalizes the spelling from Speisser in the manuscript to Speitzer in the published version, basing his spelling on other stories about the manor lord.", "danish_manuscript": "En der Per Skytte og Kr\u00e6n Gatten de sprakede\nSpeisser[s] alle hans Sideben i Stykker.

The next day, when Kr\u00e6n Gatten was at the farm doing his villeinage, and they were raking and they\u2019d finished harvesting, he stayed back a little bit, so that Speisser would come over to him. It was down in a little depression in the field. Then Speisser comes over and says, \u201cListen, Kr\u00e6sten, can you give me a light?\u201d Then he asked him, \u201cI\u2019ll give you hell.

We\u2019ll give you some more,\u201d and they took a stone and put his right hand on it and took another stone and smashed his hand with it. Then they each took a horse and rode off. \n    Then scouts were sent out to find them. They also got so close to them, they came to a place where one of them was, it was probably Skytten. They had a little baby, who was crawling about on the floor, and when they came in there to search, they put him into a closet. Then this little child says, \u201cMan in the cave, man in the cave,\u201d The mother grabbed the child and got it out of the way, so they didn\u2019t find him. Then they went up to Holsten and got away. They say that Skytten later wound up living on Funen.\n     Then they sent for the minister for this Speisser, or perhaps he came by himself.
