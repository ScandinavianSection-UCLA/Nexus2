Stories of the viper king overlap with those of lindorm, and some stories attest to their close connection (DS II E 160). \n\n     Given the potential economic windfall from being able to see into calves' bellies, it is no wonder that the horse dealer wanted the powers related to eating the viper king. In Danish legends, the horse dealer is either a dangerous character, connected to corruption and manipulation, or a perfect victim, wandering about with scads of cash (JPP 2.01). Amusingly, in this story, the young girl accidentally eats the soup. Other variants note that it is the first person who tastes the soup, particularly the fat floating on the surface, who gains the supernatural benefit (DS II E 163). In some instances, the person who eats the soup is described as becoming \"urimelig klog\" [unusually wise] (DS II E 163). \n\n     The horse dealer's attempt to buy the girl confirms his callous nature and also his desperation. The girl's parents (or guardians) would of course reap the windfall from her new found powers.", "danish_manuscript": "Hugormkongen var hvid med et r\u00f8dt Hoved\nog det var den eneste [Konge] hun der var i Boet\ndet var ligesom med Bierne.
