In many stories, the devil arrives at the pub to play cards; when he is recognized, a person at the pub sends for a wise minister or, as in this case, a dean (proust), a person slightly higher up in the church hierarchy. \n\n     Tang Kristensen did not publish this abbreviated account, likely because he had not recorded the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Fanden i den r\u00f8de Smeddi.
