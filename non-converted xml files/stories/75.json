Here, the unwitting poacher gets a magical seed in his shoes and acquires second sight. In this story, he witnesses the witches churning butter, no doubt from the cream of all the cows in the parish. Numerous stories attest to the magical qualities of bregnefr\u00f8 [bracken seed] harvested on a liminal night, generally the night of the witches' ride to the sabbath (Valborg or St. Hans eve) (AMJ 3.09). Part of the magic resides in the fact that bracken, as ferns, do not produce seeds but rather spores. Consequently bracken seeds, a biological impossibility, would necessarily be magical.", "danish_manuscript": "En Krybskytte rendte en Gang her inde i Sko-\nven, Rold Skov, og h. havde faaet noget i\nhans Sko og da h. kom ned til Katkjelde\nved Gravlev i Kj\u00e6ret, der sad Heksene \nog kj\u00e6rnede, det kunde h. se ved det h.\nhavde dh.
