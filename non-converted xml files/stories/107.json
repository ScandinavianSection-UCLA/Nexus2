In this story, the parish clerk plays a prank on the minister, highlighting the perceived tension that existed between the parish clerk and the minister. The minister, caught off guard, loses his most important possession, first to the soup pot and then to the dog. The story also plays on the motif of the devil in dog form (Woods 1958), but this dog is hardly Satanic. \n\n     The minister's amusing sermon to the parish relies on the common formulation \"falde til F\u00f8je og Takke,\" [submit and be thankful], but adds the absurd proposition that God's words are found in a dog's behind, a literal representation of what had happened but utterly incomprehensible--in fact blasphemous--in the context of a sermon. In that sense, the Rold minister's statement is reminiscent of the minister who described the antics of a runaway cow during a funeral (JPP 1.03).\n\n     This story is broken up in the manuscript, appearing unexpectedly after the episode in the preceding storyin which the shepherd agrees to stand in for the minister in Rold (BJK 3.42). It is likely that Jens digressed from his original story to tell this story, and then picked up with the shepherd confronting the king. The beginning of this story is not set off from the preceding in the manuscript, but after it ends, there is a short dash, before the other story begins once again.", "danish_manuscript": "Vidste ikke hvordan Tiden gik.

Since the minister counts his bundles every morning, he thinks that it is Saturday and it is actually Sunday.

The dish was standing beside the cabbage pot and while he was slurping it up, his book fell into the pot. He fished it out again and then he put it on a three-legged stool.
