Han var s\u00e5 grusselig h\u00e5rd ved b\u00f8nderne, at det n\u00e6sten ikke var til at holde ud. S\u00e5 var der da ogs\u00e5 nogle af hans folk, der blev enige om at undlive ham eller i det mindste sl\u00e5 ham ford\u00e6rvet, og en dag stimlede de sammen om ham ude i marken, og to karle sprang p\u00e5 ham. De fik det ligevel ikke gjort af med ham, men hans h\u00e6nder fik han nok rent smadrede. Gjerningsm\u00e6ndene r\u00f6mmede s\u00e5 til Hamborg \u2014 den ene kom for resten siden tilbage igjen.\n     Den samme Speitzer ejede ogs\u00e5 V\u00e5r og Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. Han blev ved at v\u00e6re lige h\u00e5rd ved b\u00f8nderne, og en gang tugtede han nogle folk s\u00e5 helt forf\u00e6rdelig. Men s\u00e5 et st\u00f8d efter s\u00e5 folkene p\u00e5 V\u00e5r en dag, at der gik en fremmed mand og fulgtes med Speitzer i g\u00e5rden. Den fremmede s\u00e5 noget s\u00e6r ud, men det t\u00e6nkte folkene nu ikke videre ved, de hattede jo og hilste, som det h\u00f8rte til. Speitzer og denher fremmede mand g\u00e5r nu og snakker sammen, men ingen kunde blive klog p\u00e5, hvad det var om. Folkene h\u00f8rte blot, at Speitzer til sidst sagde: \"Det t\u00e6nkte jeg \u2014 s\u00e5 bandte han \u2014 nok.\" I det samme gik han og den fremmede op ad en h\u00f6j stentrappe, og vilde da som til at ind i slottet. Men lige idet de kom til det \u00f8verste trin, h\u00f8rer folkene et skrig og ser, Speitzer stejler bagl\u00e6nds ned, og s\u00e5 var han ene \u2014 den fremmede var v\u00e6k som et stj\u00e6rneskud. Der l\u00e5 nu Speitzer og var d\u00f8d, men om han blev helt henne den gang, skal jeg ligevel ikke sige til sikkerhed; jeg tror det nok. Men efter hans d\u00f8d blev han ellers ved at f\u00e6rdes rundt omkring i egnen, is\u00e6r imellem V\u00e5r og Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. Han skulde jo s\u00e5 over fjorden, og fiskerne, som l\u00e5 der ude sommer og efter\u00e5r og fiskede om natten, b\u00e5de h\u00f8rte og s\u00e5 ham ikke \u00e9n men mange gange. Han s\u00e5 ud som en grim, stor, sort fugl, og s\u00e5 r\u00e5bte og skreg han, te det var nok skr\u00e6kkeligt at h\u00f8re, men \"skarnen\" var vel ogs\u00e5 efter ham. En gang var der et par unge fiskere, der talte ham noget slemt til en nat, de h\u00f8rte ham; men s\u00e5 havde de ham strags, og dette her skidteri tumlede nok s\u00e5dan med b\u00e5den, at fiskerne n\u00e6r havde g\u00e5et neden om og hjem.\n     Der er jo, som vi v\u00e9d nok, en grumme hoben eng langs med s\u00f8ndre side af fjorden, fra Aggersund og helt til Nibe. Alle de enge vilde Speitzer gj\u00e6rne have fingre i, og han skrev til kongen, at dersom han m\u00e5tte f\u00e5 dem, vilde han bel\u00e6gge dem med st\u00e5l og lade sine svende dandse hen over dem. Kongen studerer jo noget p\u00e5 den her skrivelse, og han vilde ogs\u00e5 nok lade Speitzer f\u00e5 engene. Men s\u00e5 havde kongen en nar, som de jo plejede i gammel tid; han skulde nu ogs\u00e5 have sin snak med om dette her, og han var ikke s\u00e5 gal som kongen. Han sagde, at st\u00e5let, engene skulde bel\u00e6gges med, var h\u00f8leer, og svendene, der skulde dandse over dem, var Speitzers hovfolk, og da kongen fik den forklaring, vilde han ikke lade Speitzer f\u00e5 engene.", "english_publication": "It isn\u2019t terribly long ago that there was a manor lord who lived at \u00d6rndrup whom they called Speitzer. He was so terribly hard on his peasants, that they could barely stand it. So there was a group of his people who agreed to kill him or, at the very least, beat him badly, and one day they surrounded him out in the field and two farmhands jumped on him. They didn\u2019t manage to kill him, but he did get his hands smashed badly. The perpetrators fled to Hamburg\u2014one of them later came back again. \n     The same Speitzer owned V\u00e5r and Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. He continued to be just as hard on his peasants, and one day he punished some people quite terribly. But a little later, the people at V\u00e5r saw one day that there was a stranger following along with Speitzer at the farm. The stranger looked kind of odd, but the people didn\u2019t pay him much mind, they doffed their hats and greeted him, as one did. Speitzer and this stranger now go and talk together, but no one could figure out what it was all about. The people only heard that Speitzer finally said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I \u2013 then he swore \u2013 thought.\u201d At the same time, he and the stranger were climbing a steep stone staircase, and made as if they were going to go into the castle. But just as they get to the top stair, they hear a scream and they see Speitzer fall backwards down the stairs, and then he was alone \u2013 the stranger had disappeared like a shooting star. Now Speitzer lay there and was dead, but if he was completely gone then I can\u2019t say for sure; I think so. After his death he continued to wander around the district, especially between V\u00e5r and Aggersborgg\u00e5rd. He wanted to cross the fjord, and the fishermen who were out there during the summer and fall and fished at night, both heard and saw him not once but many times. He looked like a big, black, ugly bird, and he shouted and yelled, and it was terrifying to hear, but the \u201cbeast\u201d was after him. One time there were a couple of young fishermen who talked badly about him one night; but then he was there immediately, and this devilry tumbled the boat so hard that the fishermen nearly went down and home. \n     There were, as we know, a  whole group of meadows down along the southern side of the fjord, from Aggersund and all the way to Nibe. Speitzer wanted his fingers in all those meadows, and he wrote to the king that, if he were allowed to have them, he would cover them with steel and let his lads dance over them. The King studies this letter a bit and he was about to let Speitzer have the meadows. But the king had a fool as was the custom in the old days; he was also to have a word about this, and he wasn\u2019t as crazy as the king. He said that the steel that the meadows were to be covered with were hay scythes, and the lads who were going to dance over them were Speitzer\u2019s villeinage peasants, and when the king got that explanation, he wouldn\u2019t let Speitzer have the meadows.", "keywords": null, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Fra hoveriets tid", "heading_english": "From the time of villeinage"}, "tango_indices": null}
