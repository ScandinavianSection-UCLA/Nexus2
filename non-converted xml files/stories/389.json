In most stories of lindorm, the serpent threatens to topple a church (DS II E 22), or simply prevents people from attending church (see KMP 2.09). The threat the lindorm poses in those stories is clearly directed at the institution of the Lutheran church and, in the period prior to the constitutional reforms of 1849, the power and the authority of the Crown. \n\n     In Peder's story, the lindorm's threat is mainly economic. The lindorm is buried out on a field, and the man, his horse and plow all represent, in encapsulated form, the agricultural basis of the economy. Peder undermines the power of the story with his amusing mention that \"things were smaller back then.\" \n\n     Stone walls, such as the one where the lindorm was buried, became a common feature of the Danish landscape after the land reforms of 1780. Walls separating fields were essential to maintain order in the crops, and to keep animals from tramping or overgrazing the fields.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var et Sted der var en Lindorm begravet\nog lige s. langt som Stendiget var der\nstod oven den lige s. lang har Lindormen\nv\u00e6ret.
