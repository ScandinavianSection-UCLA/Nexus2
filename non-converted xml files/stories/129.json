In these successful treasure hunt stories, such as this one and the preceding (BJK 4.17), the original hunter often reveals the location of his quest to an interlocutor, but gives up on the search himself. The interlocutor then acts on this information and recovers the treasure.\n\n     Tang Kristensen did not publish this account. The account is somewhat unusual for Jens, because it departs from his usual intense focus on local history and geography.
