The minister came from the field and saw this. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re sitting and doing here, my girl?\u201d he says, \u201cWho asked you to do this?\u201d Her mother had, but now the cow couldn\u2019t give any more milk, because now there came blood. Yes, she should continue as long as something came, if it was either blood or milk. Then she continued and then the cow died. It was supposedly a farmer\u2019s cow here in the town. The minister got so upset about it, that he lost his health and died a little later.
