Furrows are often seen as efficacious against magic, but usually only when they are crossed (thereby inscribing a cross into the ground), rather than being followed as they are here. \n\n      The manor lord's actions are intriguing: he brings into the open Puust-Maren's abilities as a witch, but does not raise a formal accusation of witchcraft against her. Her actions could be seen as self incrimination, a form of testimony that was not allowed in the Danish witch trials that ended in the eighteenth century (Johansen 1991; Tangherlini 2000). This prohibition against self incrimination may also explain Puust-Maren's willingness to admit to having caused her daughter's deformity.\n\n      The second story highlights another common belief about witches, namely their ability to cause illness. Certain methods, such as placing a broom at the threshold to the house, were seen as efficacious against the ability of the witch to gain entrance to a house. Strewing certain seeds, such as linseed at the threshold, could be similarly efficacious (DS V 1111). \n\n     The story may point toward the fierce competition that existed between local folk healers. Stories such as this could bolster the reputation of the successful folk healer, while casting aspersions on another. In this context, it is worth noting that one person's folk healer might be another person's witch (Muchembled 1979).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Kone i Skj\u00f8dstrup h. hed Puust\nMaren og kunde hegse og gj\u00f8re s. mange Kun-\nster.

Now when she was reading (the woman from Aarhus) and was curing the sick one, then Maren came and was so upset that it was dangerous and the man stood at the ready with the club and hit her as hard as he could and Maren didn't manage to do anything and had to go home. \"I wouldn't have thought that there was such magic here,\" said Maren, \"because then you could have let me known, and I could have cured her as well.
