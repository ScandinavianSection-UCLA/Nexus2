Because of a relative glut of young men and women looking for work, wages were poor and in many places consisted of little more than room, board, some cloth, and a nominal cash payment on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the hired hands paid close attention to the quality and quantity of food that they were served.\n\n     The farmer's wife probably used grated cheese to save cheese since it would look to be much more than it actually was. The boy's amusing attempt to catch his cheese, throwing off his clogs so that he could run faster, has the desired effect, and he gets better food in the future.", "danish_manuscript": "En dreng sad i Marken med reven Ost.\nDet vilde bl\u00e6se hen.
