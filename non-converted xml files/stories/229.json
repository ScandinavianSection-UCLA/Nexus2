At the same time, she leaves open the possibility that buried treasure, hauntings and curses exist. As with many of her other stories, this story focuses intensely on the economy of the farm. The farm is threatened by an unspecified curse. The cunning man who is called to stave off the threat proposes a course of action that is overtly rejected by the farmer. But the subsequent success of the farm, and the son's suspicions, imply that the farmer followed the cunning man's advice in secret.
