It is interesting to note that in this story the wife forces the girl--rather than her husband--into a position of public humiliation. Jens provided no explanation as to why the wife may have put her husband up to seducing the girl, and less reason for her accompanying the girl to confession. The public humiliation seems complete when the wife lifts the girl's skirt as they leave the church. Yet one can just as easily read the wife's action as one of solidarity--she supports the girl when she confesses her affair to the minister, and then crudely insults the curious villagers who have come to hear the minister scold the girl. The wife's insult is, of course, the narrative focus of the story.\n\n     The published version of the story does not include the introduction that mentions Judge Kalmar, a clear narrative link between this story and the preceding one (BJK 3.14). Similarly, the published version does not include the ambiguous reference to \"Sara.\" Since the name \"Sara\" does not appear in any of Jens's other stories, he must be either referring to a person both he and Tang Kristensen knew or, as is more likely the case, referring to the young girl who abandoned her child in the preceding story and was sentenced to die.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Birkedommer Kalmar her i Torsted-\nlund og kom vel i Begravelsen her i Kirken.\nDer var ingen Grave med Minder paa her paa\nKirkegaarden andre end en Skovfoged der havde\nlokket en Pige, maaske hans egen Kone havde\nfaaet ham til det.

She herself accompanied the girl to the church and opened the door for her when they went to confession. There were a lot of people in the church who wanted to hear how the minister would scold them. When they left the church, the wife put her arm around the girl and accompanied her down through the churchyard gate, and then she grabbed hold of the back of her skirt and lifted it up a bit and said, \"Now you've seen her from the front, and now you've seen her from behind, now you can see her right in the ass.\" So now they had that.
