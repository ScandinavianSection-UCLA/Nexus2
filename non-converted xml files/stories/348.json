The word nisse is a diminutive of the very common name Niels, and thus implies a small farmhand (Feilberg 2, 687). In her story, Margrete uses a common short form of the term, referring to the nisse as \"nis.\"\n\n     In her stories, Margrete emphasizes the economic aspects of the nisse's endeavors. The barter component of the first story should not be overlooked: in exchange for a relatively simple meal, the nisse insures a bountiful dairy output. (PJ 2.03). Nisse's seemingly excessive reaction the small portion of butter is in keeping with the extreme nature of these beings. \n\n     As with any out group transaction, value systems often do not align. A seemingly small transgression to an in group member may be quite significant to the out group, here represented by nisse. This differing value system is confirmed in the next two stories that also focus on the economics of the farm. In the first story, the nisse reveals his capacity for excess production, a form of wishful thinking on the part of farm workers. In the last of the three stories, the extreme reaction of the nisse confirms the frightening and potentially catastrophic misalignment of the human and the supernatural value systems. \n\n      The manner in which the farmhand dies echoes the death of another farmhand in one of Margrete's earlier ghost stories (AMJ 2.08). In the manuscript, there is a direct reference, missing in the published version, to Margrete's mother-in-law's ability to see ghosts. In this manner, Margrete proposes an intriguing connection between many of the supernatural beings that populate her stories and, in particular, the nisse and ghosts.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Plejemoder var fra Egaa og tjente Niels\nAndersen der.
