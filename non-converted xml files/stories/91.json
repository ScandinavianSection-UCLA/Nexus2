The first is probably a note he made reminding himself  to ask Jens to tell the story of Niels Mortensen (BJK 3.36). The next two annotations are less clear. There is no other mention of Jens Larsen and it is quite possible that Jens was simply recounting a noteworthy event. The last account has two components to it. The first part, mentioning that the hay and the chicks, is told in dialect, while the second part, refers to practices concerning the first sheaf (Sydow 1948).", "danish_manuscript": "Gl.
