The basilisk develops from the egg of an old rooster (!) (DS II E 211) or, more often, inside old casks of beer or mead (DS II E 213). The basilisk is destructive, and kills everything with which it comes into contact (DS II E 214). \n\n      In this story, the threat of the basilisk appears within the boundaries of the farm, inside an otherwise mundane, yet important, piece of equipment. The threat, like that of the robbers and witches whom preoccupy Jens Peter in his other stories, is immediate and local. The basilisk threatens not only the well being of people who see it, but also compromises the economic well being of the inn, since the sale of beer or mead is an important source of income for innkeepers.\n\n     Jens Peter maintains his keen interest in the immediate area surrounding Ugilt and its early history. In another variant of the story (JPP 4.36), he segues from a story about Skyt-Kr\u00e6n, who also appears in other stories of his (JPP 1.05). Spangerhede also appears in several of his stories (JPP 2.03 and 2.09). In this story, the wide open fields of the manor farm offer a convenient dumping ground for the terrifying creature.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var Kro i \u00e6ldre Tid i det vesterste\naf Ugilt Sogn i det Sted der ligger n\u00e6r-\nmest \u00f8sten for [Br] Ilbro ved Vejen\nud ad Ugilt.
