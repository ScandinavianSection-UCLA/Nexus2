While the published version more closely follows this version, the coda in the published version mentioning that his father had seen the ruins comes from the earlier telling.  At the end of the published version, Tang Kristensen added a secondary story told by Gerhard Peter Andersen (b. 1837-1918), a teacher in L\u00f8rslev. Andersen's story replaced an annotation at the end of the manuscript recording noting that Jens Peter's story should be compared the story by Andersen. Andersen's story is as follows:\n\n     \"Another one tells how it was the manor lord from Elling farm that started the factory which lay south of Strandby near the ocean. He had two farmhands to run it, and they switched off getting lunch from the farm. As soon as one of the farmhands had left, this mermaid came ashore and went to the hollow where the kettle was to warm herself.\" \n\n     Tang Kristensen visited G.P. Andersen's house when he visited Jens Peter in 1893 (MO III 486, 500). He had first met Andersen in 1892 (MO III 454), and had also corresponded briefly with him (MO III 458). Tang Kristensen did not collect any stories from Andersen at that time, using him more as a local contact. For example, Andersen introduced Tang Kristensen to the remarkable fairy tale teller Anders Rasmussen (see Holbek 1987; recordings Field Diary 5892a-5931a). Andersen had contributed to Grundtvig's Danske Sagn, and several of his stories, including this one, are printed in that collection (Grundtvig and Ellekilde 1944-1948, vol. 1, 340). Andersen had collected fairy tales and legends in his youth, publishing some in a small book that he gave Tang Kristensen (MO III 455), and sending others to Adjunkt Wulf in \u00c5lborg, who published some of these stories in Samlinger for jysk Historie og Topografi (MO III 455).
