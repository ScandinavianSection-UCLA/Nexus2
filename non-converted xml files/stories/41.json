The story of a wandering Norwegian ridding a farm, or even a region, of mice or rats is widely attested (DS VI 1251). In some variants, the wanderer is a Finn, although the magical Finn is not that common in Danish tradition (DS VI 1252). The generosity of the forest ranger, in contrast to the suspicious nature of his wife, is well rewarded. Although beggars and wanderers are often threatening (KMP 1.09), in certain stories, they are considered to be worth helping (KMP 2.08). \n\n     Mice and rats were a constant problem on farms, feeding on stored grain. The option of wishing the mice on a local enemy, while amusing, suggests a degree of maliciousness that would correspond to witchcraft. The forest ranger, clearly a generous and kind person, declines the offer, thus confirming (a) the degree to which mice could be a threat rather than simply a nuisance and (b) the degree to which neighbors could dislike each other.\n\n     There is a forest ranger's house at the southern border of N\u00f8rlund forest, at a location listed on maps as Trads--Tang Kristensen likely misheard Jens, and wrote Kras.", "danish_manuscript": "Der kom en gl.
