The werewolf is also a threat to the physical well-being of the insiders. In some accounts, the only way a werewolf can become free of the curse is to eat the heart of an unborn child, solidifying the werewolf's role as a threat to fertility (DS II F 2).\n\n     The werewolf in the first of Jens's stories is unusual, since werewolves are predominantly men. Women were said to perform the described ritual, usually involving a horse placenta rather than a horse hide, to avoid the pains of childbirth (DS II F 1). If the child was a boy, he would become a werewolf, and if the child a girl, she would become a mare. The horse's placenta offers a direct connection (contagious magic) to the riding of the mare, while the goal of an easy of childbirth--\"as easy as a horse giving birth\" (DS II F 4)--is related to the mimicking of childbirth in the action of passing through the placenta (sympathetic magic). The ritual is also reminiscent of the failed blood-brotherhood ritual described in G\u00edsla saga, where a piece of sod is raised on poles for the intended brothers to pass underneath. \n\n      The second story, a variant of a widely attested story of recognizing the werewolf and thereby eliminating the curse, includes the more common male werewolf. Threads or pieces of cloth caught in the farmhand's teeth are the most common tokens revealing his identity as a werewolf (DS II F 18).", "danish_manuscript": "Min Fader har fortalt at der  en G. var 2 Kj\u00e6llinger\nder trak af deres Kl\u00e6der og kr\u00f8b igj. en Heste\nhud de havde h\u00e6ngt op paa en Pind og de var\nfrugtsommelige.
