The new law still governed trade within a seven and a half kilometer radius around market towns. This prohibition contributed to a wide scale barter economy, black market sales, the fairly common phenomenon of wandering peddlers and, at the end of the century, the emergence of the purchasing cooperatives. This latter development allowed rural populations more control and much greater access to provisions, even during the late winter and early spring.", "danish_manuscript": "Dg. havde de ingen h\u00f8kere at kj\u00f8be Tilmad ved,\ns. maatte de gaa hen til dem der havde noget\nom Foraaret og klage sig: Nu har det aldrig\nv\u00e6ret s. galt med Tilbr\u00f8d som i Aar.", "english_manuscript": "There weren't any small shops where you could by provisions back then so they had to walk over to those who had some left in the spring and complain, \"It has never been as bad with provisions as it is this year.\"", "danish_publication": "Forhen havde de ingen h\u00f8kere at kj\u00f8be tilmad ved s\u00e5dan som nu.
