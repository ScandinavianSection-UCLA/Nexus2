Those robbers had gone into a farmer one Christmas eve, and he quickly realized what kind of people they were, since they each had a rifle. So then they sat down at the table, and it was set for them, and they got both food and drink. But in the meantime the farmer sent his wife out the back way and she went over to a manor farm, which is called Lundb\u00e6k. There were soldiers stationed there at that time, but there were only six, and those six didn\u2019t dare take on such a task. So they sent a messenger over to \u00d8land, they also had six. It happened rather luckily that the fjord was frozen so they could get across it on the ice. While his wife was away, the man went and poured well for his guests. They had put down their flintlock rifles, and so he filled the glasses all the way up so that they spilled over and with that opportunity he spilled some on the rifles. When the other soldiers came from \u00d8land, they were eleven all together and they stood outside and yelled hurrah! Then the robbers grabbed their rifles and wanted to shoot but they couldn\u2019t because the man had spilled moonshine on the gunpowder. All seven of them were caught and then they were executed and buried out on the heath.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["burial", "Christmas", "drinking", "execution", "farmer", "field", "food", "frozen", "grave", "guest", "heath", "ice", "manor farm", "messenger", "outside", "parents", "rifle", "robber", "seven", "shepherd", "shooting", "soldier", "south", "table", "wife"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "R\u00f8vere, drabsm\u00e6nd og tyve", "heading_english": "Robbers, murderers and thieves"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
