The motif is often referred to as the \"Wild Hunt,\" and is cataloged by Christiansen as ML5060 (Lindow 2000, 1036-1037). Jens adds an amusing element to his story, with the hunter's unusual way of cleaning himself. In another variant, the elves suggest that he cannot catch them because he has lice (DS II C 91). Using urine to combat lice may well have been a folk remedy.\n\n     The man who takes his fingers out of his ears is analogous to the farmhand or coachman who tries to witness the conjuring of a ghost, nearly causing the conjuring to fail (DS V 728). Here, the hunter is forced to chase the elf hags much further afield than he had intended. The payment the man receives for his assistance, despite its seeming banality, turns out to be extraordinary. This unusually high payment for services clearly parallels the payment the midwife to the mound dwellers receives for her help (1.11).", "danish_manuscript": "Jens J\u00e6ger kom ridende en G.
