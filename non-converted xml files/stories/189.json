The acquisition of great wealth without the proper input of work, such as occurs with successful treasure hunts or gambling, is related in these stories to antisocial behavior. The \"absenting\" from community implicit in the prohibition against speaking during the treasure hunt is a precondition for attaining great riches (from a clearly demonic creature). But the successful treasure hunt comes with a considerable downside: the destruction of the community, often represented by visions of the church or village burning. In this story, as in many of these stories, one of the treasure hunters breaks the taboo by speaking and the treasure sinks out of reach. But the community ties are reaffirmed. To emphasize the reestablishment of community, the handle of the chest is enshrined in the local church, a parallel to the use of the mound dweller's drinking horn to build a new church (KMP 1.61). \n\n     The verse the dragon quotes in this story is attested in several variant forms in Tang Kristensen's collection (DS III 2316; See also DS III 2318, 2320, and 2321). One of these variants was told by Gerhard Peter (G.P.) Andersen, who is mentioned in relation to one of Jens' stories about merfolk (DS III 2316; JPP 4.02). In some variants, witnesses see the dragon relocating, along with the treasure, from the mound to the lake. The buried treasure in the lake offers a clear parallel to stories of church bells in lakes (PJ 3.14; DS III 527, 529, 531, 533, 535). They too are often difficult to get up, but in those stories, the community's godlessness is often at the root of their inability to reacquire this clear symbol of community.\n\n     The motif of a dragon guarding a treasure is best known from the V\u00f6lsunga saga, where Fafnir, transformed from man into dragon, jealously guards his horde, only to be slain by Sigurd.", "danish_manuscript": "Der gik Sagn af at der skulde v\u00e6re s. mange\nPenge i Stovh\u00f8j--den st\u00f8rste Top af\nIlbj\u00e6rge.
