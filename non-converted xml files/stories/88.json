Here, the witch's magic relies on a form of contagion, the rope having been in close contact with the cows. In other stories, the witch steals milk by reciting a formula (DS VII 609), placing a piece of paper with writing on it in the churn (JPP 4.39; DS VII 612), or by using a milking stick (DS VII 592), a threshing tooth (DS VII 577) or even a finger of a glove (DS VII 591). \n\n     The threat to the entire community posed by the witch is made apparent in this tale. The witch directs her economic malice not at an individual farmer, but rather at the entire community. It can only be a form of poetic justice that an otherwise poor woman reaps the bounty of the witch's malice. One can perhaps read the story as a reference to the newly emergent form of assistance to the poor, where all the community members contributed to the support of the local poor.\n\n     Prior to the land reforms in the late 1780s, it was common for the town to employ a single shepherd to herd and graze all the cattle in a single village. The system provided an economy of scale, since individual herds (a generous term) rarely consisted of more than two or three cows. Once communal farming was eliminated, the position of village shepherd also disappeared.", "danish_manuscript": "Byhjodden i Aarestrup hed B\u00e5j-M\u00e5ten og \nh. gik om Morgenen og raabte og st\u00f8jede og\ntudede i hans Horn og dem der kom ikke tid-\nlig nok ud med H\u00f8vderne, de maatte drive af-\nsted.
