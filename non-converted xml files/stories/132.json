Kold-Jens relies on his own personal experience with a piece of rope to influence the actions of his successors. The story is not so much about a threat made good as it is about potential threat, one informed by other stories of unfortunate interactions with mound dwellers. \n\n     Mounds were often leveled during the nineteenth century in a bid to increase arable land and for marl. Marl, coupled to better crop rotation policies, and improved drainage radically changed the yield of Danish fields up through the latter decades of the century (Bj\u00f8rn and Dahlerup 1988, vol. 3).\n\n     There are several prominent mounds in the area south of Ersted, although none of them are labeled Persh\u00f8j on any maps.
