In Jens's story, the mound dweller's wife is a human, explaining why she needs a human midwife. In many variants where the woman giving birth is human, she turns out to have been kidnapped into the mound, usually as a young child (DS I 860; DS I 869). Here, the kidnapping has taken place in infancy, and she is identified as a changeling. The need for a human (read Christian) midwife is somewhat harder to explain, since the changeling was presumably never baptized, and therefore much more easily assimilated into the world of mound dwellers.\n\n     The mound dweller's wife provides assistance to the midwife, providing her with a series of instructions to successfully escape the underground world. Unlike the fairytale, where such instructions (and prohibitions) would go unheeded, the midwife follows the instructions to the letter, and is richly rewarded.\n\n     As in many of these stories, the gift of the mound dweller seems at first glance to be worthless. The differing value systems of the out group are made explicit in the type of payment; once the seemingly modest, or even useless, payment is accepted (and not discarded), it turns out to be quite substantial.\n\n     The instruction to hold onto the door knocker is not widely attested, although it does occur in other variants (DS I 1122). The door, or the door knocker, must be linked to the liminality of the physical threshold/door that literally separates the inside from the outside. Tang Kristensen initially writes \"Tronbusk\" for the hawthorn bush the woman is to hold onto, transposing the \"r\" and the \"o\" and forgetting to include an \"e\"; he corrects this at the next mention of the bush. Although hawthorn is used in various folk remedies, here the requirement that she hold the hawthorn bush is more related to unlikely actions, because hawthorn bushes are covered by spines; deliberately holding onto a hawthorn is not normal, thus picking up on the liminal--and dangerous--nature of this interaction.", "danish_manuscript": "Else Hohus i R\u00e6vild var ned at forl\u00f8se en\nBj\u00e6rgmands Kone.
