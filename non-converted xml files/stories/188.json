There are numerous legends that explain the absence of wolves in Denmark, attributing it to the actions of a witch who bargains for her head (DS VII 690). The unusual greeting occurs in other variants of this story, and is explained that, had the witch's interlocutor called the animals by name (wolves), they would have torn him apart (DS VII 696 and 700).\n\n     In the late seventeenth century, witches were dealt with harshly. The Danish Law of 1683 includes the following stipulation for their punishment: \"Befindis nogen Troldmand, eller Troldqvinde, at have forsoret Gud og sin hellige Daab og Christendom, og hengivet sig til Dievelen, den b\u00f8r levendis at kastis paa Ilden og opbr\u00e6ndis\" [If any troll-man or troll-woman (witch) has been found to have rejected God and his or her Holy Baptism, and given him or herself to the Devil, then they should be thrown alive onto the fire and be burned up] (Bk 6, Ch 1, Par 9). The last witch trial in Denmark that ended in an execution by burning was in 1725, although the last execution of a witch was in 1800 (Henningsen 1975; Davies and Bl\u00e9court 2004).", "danish_manuscript": "Der er en Grd i Astrup der hedder Torne.\nDen gl.
