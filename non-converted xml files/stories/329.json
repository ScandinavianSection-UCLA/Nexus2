Although Margrete stays in the realm of the supernatural, she turns her attention to the wise minister, Pastor Kattrup. In general, the abilities of the wise minister  align with those of the more secular cunning man or cunning woman. Although there is a tendency to translate \"klog\" as \"wise,\" these \"wise folk\" are more commonly referred to as \"cunning folk\" or \"folk healers\" in Anglo-American tradition. The conflict between cunning folk and wise ministers appears frequently in Danish legends, and points toward the tension between the secular and the ecclesiastic in late nineteenth century Denmark (DS VII 176).\n\n     In the first account, the emphasis is on the wise minister's ability to counteract the economic threat of theft by revealing the location of a stolen object (showing again) or otherwise revealing the identity of a thief (KMP 1.56, 1.57) . The minister's powers fail when scissors are put to the canvas, reflecting the power of metal and knives to interfere with the supernatural.\n\n     The second legend is widely attested in Danish tradition (DS IV 1120, IV 1121). Kathleen Stokker interprets Norwegian variants of the legend as related to the power of the Lutheran minister and the role of confession in Lutheran practice (Stokker 1989). The story certainly plays on the power of the minister to counteract the intrusion of the otherworldly into the community. One of the minister's emblems of power is his book. In some variants of the legend, the book is specified as the Black Book, in others, the Bible (DS V 700) and parallels the cunning folk's use of the Cyprianus. The black book is often used in conjuring ghosts. \n\n     The hapless farmhand who has little business walking about in the liminal space of the cemetery at night is treated as a ghost, even after he reveals himself to be human. He is summarily conjured into the ground and his death. The conflation of Satan and ghosts reflects the Lutheran theological accommodation to the widespread popular belief in ghosts (Tangherlini 1999). The minister's seeming powerlessness to stop the conjuring reveals a chink in his armor: either he is powerless in the face of these greater forces or he proffers a punishment out of all proportion to the farmhand's offense. In either case, the implications are not reassuring. \n\n     The final story also explores the power of the minister, here to reanimate the dead. Blame for the man's suicide is attributed to the wife and the story can thus be read as a negative commentary on marriage. Up through the nineteenth century, people were laid out on straw after death until burial two to three days later. The minister's correspondence with Copenhagen reveals the role of central authorities in local affairs, a matter of great political debate in the last decades of the nineteenth century (N\u00f8rr 1994).", "danish_manuscript": "Pastor Katrup i Skj\u00f8dstrup kunde vise igjen\nH. spurgte hans Kone om hans L\u00e6rred var\nikke henne.
