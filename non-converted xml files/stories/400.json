Wages for farmhands and day laborers were very low, largely because of a glut of workers. Many contracts simply offered food, lodging, and a very small stipend paid quarterly or semi annually (Hvidt and Olsen 1990).\n\n     The manor lady's churchgoing is unusual, taking place on a day and at a time not generally associated with churchgoing. Her solitary (rather than communal) use of the church mimics her selfishness and stinginess. It also leaves her wide open to apparent supernatural (Satanic) attack. The farmhand plays on this liminality in his successful attempt to trick her.\n\n     Peder's story is reminiscent of the story of the would-be ghost (ML3005) (Stokker 1992). In those stories, however, the corrective is misguidedly aimed at the minister who turns out to be engaged in the necessary protection of the community from evil, and the farmhand is appropriately--if somewhat harshly--punished.\n\n     Peder tells several stories of farmhands who trick their superiors for their own personal gain (PJ 1.02 and 2.27). Here, of course, the manor lady, much like the harsh manor lord at Urup (PJ 2.01), deserves to be punished for the mistreatment of her workers.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Kone som var vel knap med hen-\ndes Folk.
