The linked stories reveal Jermiin's remarkable magical power. Encircling things frequently has magical efficacy, and is a common approach to stopping wildfire in Danish legends (DS VI 1199). Tang Kristensen attributed two other stories about Jermiin's ability to stop wildfires to himself (DS VI 1204 and 1206).\n\n    The second story in this recording combines aspects of showing again and binding thieves. Although forcing thieves out of a small opening, usually in the window lead, is attested elsewhere, it is more common to force Satan out of such an opening (DS VI 478). The thieves, however, are no ordinary thieves, stealing the very emblems of the church that are related to ideas of community and salvation. Accordingly, they can be seen as Satanic themselves.\n\n     As he does in several stories, Jens Peter includes a coda that ties the story into his immediate sphere, here linking the story to a woman whom he knew well. The place name Serridslev should be emended to Serritslev. The Store Vildmose was an enormous swamp seventeen kilometers southwest of Serritslev. It is now much smaller than it once was; large parts of it were drained and sold as small holdings in the late nineteenth century.", "danish_manuscript": "En Kapellan [Pr\u00e6st] i Serridslev var Kappel-\nlan og boede i Annexgaarden, h.\nhed Jermin og var s. klog.
