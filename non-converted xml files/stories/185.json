The mound dwellers are the most likely culprits in this case, particularly given Jens Peter's comments about their thieving nature (JPP 4.09).\n\n    The farm also happens to be threatened by disruptive haunts. Jens Peter implies a hierarchy in who can best deal with haunts, proposing cunning folk as the first line of defense, and wise ministers as the more powerful, second line of defense. Ultimately, the haunt is conjured, but unusual happenings ultimately lead to the financial ruin of the farm.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var herude i Jerslev Sogn i det \u00f8sterste\nfor en 30 Aar siden blev saadan en Ting\nDer bliver deres Faar henne en Aften\nog s. kommer de ud alle Folkene og skal\nud og s\u00f8ge efter dem.
