The farmhand appeals to a local cunning man, and the advice he receives is sound. In the resolution, the witch is revealed to be the dean's wife. \n\n     The implicit connection in this story between the dean and Satan can be interpreted in several ways. On the one hand, that the dean is married to a witch suggests a profound degree of corruption and hypocrisy in the high church officer's own home. On the other hand, the marriage to the well-concealed witch--and by extension the devil--may suggest that this Satanic threat has reached the innermost circle of the church undetected, and thus threatens the very foundations of the community.\n\n      The boy's symptoms are similar to those of people who have been ridden by the mare; the witch's ride is an analogous phenomenon (KMP 1.37; DS II F 90, 93-95). In this story, the boy, transformed into a horse, is able to turn the tables on the witch, and have her shod before revealing her identity. Revealing the identity of the witch often included public humiliation (JPP 1.05).\n\n      Troms cathedral in Norway was the Danish tradition dominant for the location of the witches' sabbath. Bloksbj\u00e6rg, a mountain in an unspecified, yet distant location, is also widely attested as the location of this gathering (DS VII 335 and 336). Both Voldborg (Valborg) eve (May 1), and St. Hans eve (June 23) are widely attested as the night that the witches ride to Troms\u00f8.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en af Jens Aldals Familie ham red en\nHegs paa til Troms Kirke, en Provstes Frue fra\nSmoddup (Ravnkilde).
