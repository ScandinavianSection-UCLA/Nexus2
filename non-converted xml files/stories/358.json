Margrete adds the personal connection to Anders V\u00e6vers's nisse, in the guise of her stepmother who, like her father, was born on a calendrically liminal day, in this case Christmas. In this telling, Margret attributes the protection of the apple orchard to the nisse rather than to Anders V\u00e6ver. \n\n     The animals that the nisse sends to distract the thieves are reminiscent of the animals that appear during quests for buried treasure, and help link the nisse more definitively to the demonic (PJ 2.10). The nisse apparently takes the family's wealth away after Anders dies. \n\n     Anders's haunt is described more explicitly here than in the earlier variant as a guilty haunt. Unlike other stories that Margrete tells in which the solicitous guilty haunt is confronted, this haunt is never confronted. Rather than the positive resolutions that mark her legends in which haunts are confronted or conjured, the resolution of this story is decidedly negative: Anders's farm is laid waste and his children end up destitute.", "danish_manuscript": "I Anders V\u00e6vers gaard i Egaa tjente\nmin Stifmoder i 14 Aar.
