He had a coachman called Daniel who was both wise and crazy. One day, when they were driving to church, the coachman says to the minister, \"There's a girl going along the street, she's my sweetheart, but I don't really like her, because she's both twisted and off kilter, what does Father think of her?\" Yes, he thought she was nice enough. But the coachman didn't think so and it ended up that he fell in love with another girl and was going to get married to her. Then the minister says in the marriage vows, \"Here the crow has found one like him, one that is neither twisted nor off kilter nor hooked on her ass.\" The coachman got what was coming to him there and after that they got a real set of marriage vows. Another time they were driving to Tolne church, which was at that time an annex, the minister said to the coachman, \"I'd like it if you went out to the butcher who lives next to the church and get a piece of meat for me.\" He went too but the butcher said that he could tell the minister that when he'd paid for the last piece of meat he'd gotten then he could get some more. Well, now the coachman comes into the church and the minister was preaching from Daniel's book and he says, \"Well, what does Daniel say?\" The coachman gets up in his seat and says, \"Daniel said that when the minister has paid for what he'd received then he could get some more.\" The butcher was called Daniel. They get home and the minister scolds him for saying that in church and almost disturbing him. But they worked it out. He used to go about on the weekdays thatching with a cotter.
