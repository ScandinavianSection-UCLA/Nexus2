The implication in this story is that the inn was the site of several grisly murders. The actual crime remains unsolved, and the skeletons are buried in properly consecrated ground. While one would expect Jens Peter to tell stories about hauntings occurring at the inn, he does not. He does however connect the appearance of the basilisk with the skeletons, proposing that all sorts of bad things--such as murder and witchcraft--plagued the area in the past.\n\n     Numerous stories tell of wandering merchants who have been murdered, and their remains found many years later (DS IV 1371). In these stories, murders often take place at inns (DS IV 1384 and JPP 2.14), or events leading up to a murder stem from an encounter at the inn (JPP 2.01 and 2.02). \n\n     In a later telling of this story (JPP 4.36), Jens Peter reverses the order of the stories, recounting the grisly find at the location of the old inn before telling about the basilisk (JPP 2.11).", "danish_manuscript": "Ved den\ngl.
