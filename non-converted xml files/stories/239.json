Boberg links the mound dweller's request to the concept of the gift, an economic concept taken up by Mauss (1954). The transaction described in this legend is not, however, a gift. Rather, it is more closely related to out group barter transactions (Tangherlini 1998). Despite the penetration of a monetized economy into most aspects of Danish life in the late nineteenth century, a great deal of economic activity still relied on barter (Hvidt and Olsen 1990). The rules governing such transactions are often hard to discern, and there is often a nagging question as to whether a barter deal was \"fair.\" \n\n     In many variants, the farmhand is hesitant to eat the food proffered in return for his services, since food prepared by outsiders (in this case, presumably supernatural outsiders) can be dangerous. Accordingly, different variants explore the different strategies--and outcomes of those strategies--for dealing with the interaction (BJK 4.22; JPP 4.04). In this case, the farmhand eats the cake with the end result that things go well for him. Here, Kirsten Marie endorses the concept of out group barter transaction. Such an attitude eschews the zero-sum notion of \"limited good\" that Foster examined in the context of peasant societies (Foster 1965). Instead, Kirsten Marie proposes that the economic pie can and should be expanded. This stance aligns well with her own social position, since the farm owning class was eager to expand opportunities for economic activity beyond the local market town.", "danish_manuscript": "Henne i Voldum var en Karl der drev og\npl\u00f8jede imellem Voldum og Hvall\u00f8s og der laa\nen bitte H\u00f8j og s. kom der, mens h. var hene\nved den anden Ende en Raag og den var i\n\n5216A\nstkker.
