Liebrecht (1856) noted the similarity of this tale to Plutarch's story of Pan's death in De defectu oraculorum [On the disappearance of Oracles] (Boberg 1934, 7). Boberg, in her study of the Nordic variants of the story, proposed four main groupings: (1) Danish anthropomorphic supernatural beings (2) Danish cats (3) Swedish-Norwegian anthropomorphic supernatural beings and (4) Swedish-Norwegian cats (Boberg 1934, 14). Boberg observed that the death message generally results in an expression of sorrow in stories from groups 1 and 3, and an expression of joy in stories from groups 2 and 4 (Boberg 1934, 53). \n\n    Jens Peter draws an intriguing connection between the large tomcat who suddenly appears at the mill and mound dwellers. Although Boberg suggests that there are two distinct types of stories--one with mound dwellers, and one with cats--Jens Peter concatenates the two types here (Boberg 1934, 53). Interestingly, when a tomcat  appears in another of Jens Peter's stories, it is the devil in cat form (JPP 4.05).\n\n     The cat is clearly disruptive in the mill, killing both of the other cats. Cats are important at a mill since they keep the very destructive mice at bay. This cat, however, eats far more than its share of food and is a far greater menace than mice.  The joy that the cat / mound dweller expresses at the otherwise incomprehensible message is paralleled by the joy and relief of the people at the mill when the cat leaves.\n\n     Earlier interpretations of the legend have tried to connect the stories to ritual and cult practice, or to natural phenomena. Two nineteenth century German scholars, Wilhelm Mannhardt and G. A. Gerhard linked the story to the Sumerian-Babylonian god of fertility, Tam\u00fbz, an analog to the Greek god, Adonis, and fertility cults. In contrast, Taylor linked the stories to sounds such as the wind in the trees (Boberg 1934, 9-10; Taylor 1922).\n\n     None of these interpretations make much sense. Much of the narrative tension is related to the interaction between the supernatural being and the humans, and the humans are almost universally surprised to discover supernatural beings (or supernatural cats) living in their midst when they report the otherwise cryptic message. Once the death has been announced, the cat or supernatural being leaves, and the implicit thievery of the other world ends. Lindow proposes, in this connection, that a death among the supernatural beings is always a good thing for the human world (Lindow 2008).", "danish_manuscript": "For en 100 Aar siden var der kommen en\ngrum stor Hankat til Boller Vand-\nm\u00f8lle og h. slog alle de andre Katte\nihjel.
