The story conflates aspects of folk belief with Lutheran teaching. The girl, much like the sailor in the previous story (JPP 4.05), absents herself from the company of others and moves into darkness. This move can be read symbolically as an act parallel to the contemplated suicide that will wrest her from the community. Satan's role as the king of darkness contrasts sharply with God's kingdom of light, a kingdom that the girl inadvertently summons when she says the Lord's prayer. Jens Peter's mention of a person named Gotfred is interesting, since it appears to be a reference to another story, yet this is the only story in which a Gotfred appears.", "danish_manuscript": "Der oppe i Stenum var en Pige forlovet. \nS. slaar Kj\u00e6resten ham fejl og hu gik en\n\n7805B\n6, 8 Dage og spekulerede paa at tage Livet\naf sig selv.
