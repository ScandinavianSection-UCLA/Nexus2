Although the tale at first blush seems believable, the manor lord's eventual slaughter of the beggars-turned-robbers brings to mind tales cataloged as ATU 956, \"The Hot Chamber in the House of Robbers\", and its close analogs (ATU 956a and b).\n\n      The story has two distinct parts: The first part deals with the vengeful nature of Klaus and his family after they have been put off their farm. The second part deals with the attack on the farm by the \"robbers\" and the manor lord's strength and ability to protect the farmers in his district.\n\n     Peder addresses several critical issues in this the first story that he told Tang Kristensen. The parceling of farms after the land reforms of 1780 led to a significant increase in the number of farms and houses that were no longer leaseholds. After the reorganization of the fields, many people discovered that, despite the proximity of their fields to their neighbors, the fields could be of greatly differing quality. \n\n     The parceling of lands also required that people, long used to a different mode of existence, were now forced to confront the demands of self sufficiency and the rough and tumble of a free market economy (Christiansen 1996 and 1975). In some cases, farmers were unable to keep up with the demands of the new economic structures, and ultimately were forced off their land. Those vacated farms were either offered to new farmers or bought out by neighbors. \n\n     At the time when Peder told this story, care of the poor and the causes of poverty were subjects of great currency in local political debates. Most people agreed that there were two classes of paupers: those who deserved help since they were poor through no fault of their own (advanced age, poverty, feebleness), and those who did not deserve help since they were poor by choice (drunks, able-bodied poor, freeloaders) (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). Legislation after the 1860s recognized these different classes of poor. Those who could work but chose not to were often forced onto labor farms (fattigg\u00e5rde) (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). In Peder's story, the family which is too lazy to work is first thrown off their land, and later executed.\n\n     Peder also addresses the problem of beggars and vagabonds in this story, a problem that animates Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter's storytelling. In Peder's story, the lazy farmer and his family become wandering craftsmen. An alternate reading is that they are simply masquerading as potters and are actually earning their keep as thieves. The later reference to them as \"robbers\" suggests this reading may be more accurate. In either case, the implication that wandering merchants were shifty characters aligns well with much of the debate concerning care for the poor and legislation aimed at stemming the tide of rural begging and wandering (J\u00f8rgensen 1940).  \n\n     The strategy that Poul and his hired girl adopt to eliminate the threat posed by Klaus and his sons has a fairly harsh outcome. The \"one that got away\" allows for the threat to persist, and resists a positive resolution.\n\n      Paradoxically, the return of Klaus's family, now robbers, is heralded by another wanderer. The warning comes as repayment for Poul's previously generous and merciful treatment of that wanderer. Many rural communities encouraged legislation that relied on the goodwill of the population, rather than the burden of additional taxes, to provide for the poor. A story such as this would, of course, provide grist for the rhetorical mill supporting that policy.\n\n     The manor lord's protection of the farmer hearkens back to a previous era, when the farms in the district were owned by the manor, and protection of the estate was a prime responsibility of the lord (Christiansen 1996). Although the manor lord protects Poul and his family, he also takes quite a bit, represented symbolically in this tale by the preposterously large meal that he eats. The meal is so large, in fact, that it becomes memorialized in the landscape, lending its name to a local town (based on the false etymological equation: Dover = davre = breakfast). \n\n     The use of etiological tags, such as Dover, can anchor a story in the immediate locale. In narrative, etiological tags act as a form of external confirmation while, at the same time, attach the story to recognizable features of the landscape.\n\n    The published version of the story differs little from the manuscript version.", "danish_manuscript": "Der boede en M. i Illerup, der hed Hjelmslev\nog h. var Herremd. og det var et Mske der var\nbekjendt for at v\u00e6re s. voldsom st\u00e6rk.

Det var en\nHolt, og der er nu et Hus som kaldes\nHjelmslev huset.", "english_manuscript": "There was a man who lived in Illerup who was called Hjelmslev and he was a manor lord. He was renowned for being immensely strong. When he sat in a chair he was so strong that seven farmhands could tie a rope around him and still couldn't pull him out of the chair. He had a sword that had a name I can't remember, nor how big it was. He ruled the peasant farms in the area. Half way between Dover church and Illerup there were two solitary farms, and in one of them there was a man who had six sons, but they wouldn't do a thing and so they couldn't pay their debts. He forced them out of the house, and nobody came to live there afterward since it had been so damaged that nobody could live there, and so he put the land under another farmstead. The man who lived there was called Poul, but I can't remember the other one's name, I think it was Klaus. So now these seven vagabonds had nothing to eat, and since the manor lord was the reason they didn't have any bread, they swore that he'd experience misfortune, but first Poul would get what he had coming to him since it was him who'd gotten their property. They disappeared completely from the area, and people neither heard from them nor asked about them for quite a while until people thought they were dead and gone and they wouldn't see them again. Poul had been afraid, but now he felt safe again. Then late one winter evening, a potter came and wanted to stay at Poul's place and since he was a kind person, he said yes right away as usual. The man wanted to get his wagon under cover, but it wasn't possible because back then people didn't have as large houses as they do now, there wasn't any more shelter than for themselves. It wound up being parked just outside next to a pond of water. Just about bed time, the hired girl went out to get a bucket of water and she hears some people speaking inside the wagon. So she goes over and listens and it turns out to be one of Klaus's sons and Klaus himself who are lying there talking, wondering if the people weren't going to go to bed soon, it was ridiculous how long it was taking. She goes back inside and in the meantime they'd set up a bed for the other one, and he had already gone to bed. She tells Poul what she'd heard, and they agree to go out and tip the wagon with all the pots and everything else down into that water hole. Then they hurried around behind the end of the house and stand there listening, because it was really close to the house that waterhole. Then they see the other one come jumping out of the window, but there wasn't anything he could do, the other two had drowned. When he realized that, he ran away and left the horses and the wagon behind. A little while passed, but in the quiet week just before Maundy Thursday, a poor person came running as fast as he could to Poul and told him that he'd been sleeping in a barn out on Sjelle heath the previous night and he'd lain there and listened to how the other five had plotted that on Maundy Thursday morning, they'd kill him. Since Poul had been nice to him, he'd do him the favor of telling him. Poul didn't know what to do, he couldn't run away and desert his house and cattle, since then they'd just destroy everything. By the same token he couldn't let himself be destroyed, and in this way he ate up the day. When it started to get really light, he started to get uneasy. But just then the manor lord Hjelmslev came riding by on his way to church. Then Poul went out to him and told him how things stood concerning these five guys. Then he said, \"Well, its possible that it's nothing other than a trick, but it could also be true. So if you'll treat me to a good meal, then I'll watch out for them, and if they come, I'll make up for it.\" You see, now they had other things to think about than these hooligans, now they had to serve up a meal for the manor lord who was a really big eater. There made huge preparations. Eggs and a shoulder of pork, that was the only pork they had in the house, but he ate it. As they were sitting there, right in the middle of the meal, the Dover church bell rang the last time, and as soon as it was done, the robbers began pounding on the door. Then the manor lord says, \"It's annoying how eager they are, can't you tell them to wait until I'm done?\" Poul also talked to them but they didn't pay too much attention. \"Well, sit down for a little while by the door, for God's sake, I want to finish.\" Now they pounded again, but it was a little door and they couldn't really get at it, and he said that if they'd wait just a second, he'd open the door voluntarily. So, satisfied, they gave him a little while. Eventually, he finished and then he got up from the table and took his saber and then said to Poul that he could open the door now, but they better not come more than one at a time. Poul did that too and they came only one at a time, and then the manor lord stood inside and chopped their heads off and kicked their bodies aside. They didn't suspect a thing, even though they thought that it took a while, but they didn't manage to warn each other before the last one was kaput. Then the manor lord said, \"Now I've made up for the meal.\" From that time on, the church has been called Dover church, and the place has been called Hjelmslev. The place. It was a small clearing and there's a cotter's place now which is called Hjelmslev house.", "danish_publication": "Der boede en herremand i Illerup, der hed Hjelmslev, og det var et menneske, der var bekjendt for at v\u00e6re s\u00e5 voldsom st\u00e6rk. N\u00e5r han sad i en stol og syv af de st\u00e6rkeste karle slog et reb om l\u00e6nden af ham, kunde de ikke tr\u00e6kke ham af stolen. Han havde et sv\u00e6rd, der havde et navn, som a ikke kan mindes, og m\u00e5let p\u00e5 det heller ikke. Den herremand r\u00e5dte for b\u00f8ndergodset der omkring. Midt vejs mellem Dover kirke og Illerup var to enstedg\u00e5rde, og i den ene var en mand, der havde 6 s\u00f6nner, men de vilde ingen ting bestille, og s\u00e5 kunde de ikke svare deres skyld. Herremanden jog dem da ud af huset, og der kom ingen igjen, for det var blevet s\u00e5 ramponeret, at ingen kunde bo i det, men jorden lagde han under et andet sted. Den mand hed Povl, men ham, der blev jaget v\u00e6k, han hed Klavs. Nu havde deher 7 drabanter jo ikke noget at ern\u00e6re dem ved, og da herren var skyld i, at de var bleven br\u00f8dl\u00f8se, svor de ham en ulykke, men f\u00f8rst skulde Povl have, for det var ham, der havde f\u00e5et deres ejendom. De forsvandt nu helt fra egnen, og folk hverken h\u00f8rte eller spurgte dem i l\u00e6ngere tid. S\u00e5 troede man, de var b\u00e5de d\u00f8d og v\u00e6k. Povl havde v\u00e6ret r\u00e6d en tid, men nu blev han tryg igjen. S\u00e5 en sildig aftenstund hen p\u00e5 vinteren kom der en pottekj\u00f8rer og vilde logere ind ved Povl, og da han var et godsindet menneske, sagde han straks ja som s\u00e6dvanlig. Vognen vilde manden haft i husly, men det kunde nu ikke lade sig gj\u00f8re, for i den tid var folk ikke s\u00e5 bemidlede med hus som nu om tider. Vognen kom da til at st\u00e5 udenfor lige ved siden af en vanddam. Hen ved sengedags gik pigen ud at hente en spand vand, og da h\u00f8rer hun nogen, der snakker i vognen. S\u00e5 g\u00e5r hun hen og st\u00e5r og lytter, og da er det en af Klavses s\u00f6nner og Klavs selv, der ligger og snakker, om folkene ikke snart kunde v\u00e6re g\u00e5ede til sengs, det var voldsomt, s\u00e5 lang tid det tog. Imeldergodlag hun havde v\u00e6ret ude, havde de f\u00e5et en seng stilt an til den anden, og han var g\u00e5et til sengs. S\u00e5 fort\u00e6ller hun Povl, hvad hun havde h\u00f8rt, og de kommer til ens om i al stilhed at g\u00e5 ud og v\u00e6lte vognen med potter og samt ned i det vandhul. Dern\u00e6st skubber de dem om ved enden af huset og st\u00e5r og lytter, for hullet var t\u00e6t derved. Da seer de, den anden kommer springende ud af vinduet, men nu var der ikke noget for dem at gj\u00f8re, de andre to var druknede, og da han m\u00e6rker det, str\u00f8g han af og lod b\u00e6ster og vogn i stikken. S\u00e5 gik der en lille tid, men s\u00e5 i den stille uge lige op til skj\u00e6rtorsdag kom der en stakkel strygende hen til Povl, alt hvad remmer og t\u00f6j kunde holde, og fortalte, at han havde logeret i en lade p\u00e5 Sjelle hede om natten og der ligget og h\u00f8rt, hvordan 5 personer havde lagt r\u00e5d op om at bes\u00f8ge ham skj\u00e6rtorsdag morgen, og s\u00e5 skulde kan f\u00e6ldes. Men for det Povl havde v\u00e6ret god imod ham, vilde han gj\u00f8re ham den tjeneste at komme over at sige ham det. Povl vidste ikke, hvad han skulde gj\u00f8re. Han kunde ikke rende fra det hele og lade hus og kv\u00e6g i stikken, for s\u00e5 lagde de det jo helt \u00f8de. Nej, s\u00e5 kunde han da for den sags skyld selv blive \u00f8de ogs\u00e5, alts\u00e5 bej han dagen op. Men den gang det blev rigtig lyst, begyndte han lige godt at blive bet\u00e6nkelig. S\u00e5 kom herremanden Hjelmslev ridende forbi og vilde til kirke. Povl gik ud til ham og fortalte ham, hvordan sagerne de stod ang\u00e5endes deher fem. \"Ja, det kan jo godt v\u00e6re, at det ikke er til andet end til at narre os med, men det kan og godt v\u00e6re sandt. Men dersommentid du vil give en god davre, s\u00e5 vil a opholde mig efter dem, og kommer de, skal a nok gj\u00f8re ligen for dem.\" Se, nu skulde de jo rette an for herremanden, der var s\u00e5 meget en gr\u00e5dig \u00e6der, og de fik travlt med at gj\u00f8re store anstalter. En fl\u00e6skebov var alt hvad fl\u00e6sk de havde i huset, og s\u00e5 fik han \u00e6g dertil, og han \u00e5d det altsammen. Allerbedst som de sad, midt i m\u00e5ltidet, s\u00e5 ringede Dover klokke sidste gang, og det f\u00f8rste den var f\u00e6rdig, s\u00e5 begyndte r\u00f6verne at dundre p\u00e5 d\u00f6ren. S\u00e5 siger herremanden: \"Det er sv\u00e6rt, s\u00e5 j\u00f6ver de er, sig til dem, te jeg er ikke rigtig f\u00e6rdig.\" Povl talte ogs\u00e5 til dem, men det agtede de kun lidt om. \"Ja, s\u00e6t nu lidt for d\u00f6ren, for jeg vil miss\u00e6l v\u00e6re f\u00e6rdig.\" Nu bumrede de jo p\u00e5, men det var en lilleagtig d\u00f6r, og de kunde ikke ret komme til, og han sagde, at dersom de nu vilde t\u00f8ve lidt, s\u00e5 skulde han frivillig lukke op. De gav dem da ogs\u00e5 tilfreds den stund. Omsiger var han f\u00e6rdig og rejste sig op fra bordet, tog sin sabel og sagde til Povl, at nu m\u00e5tte han lukke op, men der m\u00e5tte ikke svar velkomme uden \u00e9n ad gangen. Povl gjorde det s\u00e5dan, at der heller ikke kom uden \u00e9n, og s\u00e5 stod herremanden inden for og hug hovedet af dem, som de kom, og sparkede kroppen til side. De fik ingen mistanke, omendskj\u00f6ndt de nok tykte, det bundtede noget med det, men de kunde heller ikke komme af sted med at advare hinanden, n\u00e5r de forst var kommen indenfor, for s\u00e5 var de kaput med det samme. Da den sidste vor sl\u00e5et ihjel, sagde herremanden: \"Nu har jeg gjort ligen for min davre.\" Fra den tid af kaldes kirken Dover kirke, og stedet, hvor r\u00f6verne dr\u00e6btes, kaldtes Hjelmslev-jorden. Det var en holdt, og der er nu et hus, som kaldes Hjelmslev-huset.", "english_publication": "There was a manor lord who lived in Illerup who was called Hjelmslev, and he was a man who was renowned for being immensely strong. If he sat in a chair and seven farmhands bound a rope around him, they couldn't pull him from the chair. He had a sword which had a name I can't remember, nor its length. This manor lord ruled the peasant farms in that area. Halfway between Dover church and Illerup there were two single farms [enstedg\u00e5rde], and in one of them there was a man who had six sons, but they wouldn\u2019t do a thing and then they couldn\u2019t pay their debt and the manor lord forced them out of the house, and nobody came to live there afterward since it had been so damaged that nobody could live there, and so he put the land under another farmstead. The man who got the land was named Poul, and the one who got chased away was named Klaus. Now these seven vagabonds had nothing to eat, and since the manor lord was the reason they didn\u2019t have any bread, they swore that he\u2019d experience misfortune, but first Poul would get what he had coming to him since it was he who\u2019d gotten their property. They disappeared completely from the area, and people neither heard from them nor asked about them for quite a while. So then people thought they were dead and gone. Poul had been afraid for a while, but now he felt safe again. Then late one winter evening, a potter came and wanted to stay at Poul\u2019s place and since he was a kind person, he said yes as usual. The man wanted to get his wagon under cover, but it wasn\u2019t possible because back then people didn\u2019t have as large houses as they do now. The wagon wound up being parked just outside next to a pond. Just about bedtime, the hired girl went out to get a bucket of water and then she hears some people speaking inside the wagon. So she goes over and listens and it turns out to be one of Klaus\u2019s sons and Klaus himself who are lying there talking, wondering if the people weren\u2019t going to go to bed soon, it was ridiculous how long it was taking. While she\u2019d been out, they\u2019d set up a bed for the other one [the potter], and he had already gone to bed. Then she tells Poul what she\u2019d heard, and they go quietly outside together and tip the wagon with all the pots and everything else down into that water hole. Then they go and wait behind the end of the house and stand there listening, because the water hole was close by. Then they see the other one come jumping out of the window, but there wasn\u2019t anything for him to do, since the other two had drowned and when he realizes that, he runs away and leaves the horses and the wagon there. Then a little while passed, but in the quiet week just before Maundy Thursday, a poor person came running as fast as he could to Poul and told him that he\u2019d been sleeping in a barn out on Sjelle heath the previous night and he\u2019d lain there and listened to how five people had discussed visiting him [Poul] Maundy Thursday morning, and then they\u2019d kill him. But because Poul had been nice to him, he\u2019d do him the favor of coming over and telling him about it. Poul didn\u2019t know what to do. He couldn\u2019t run away from it all and desert his house and cattle, because then they\u2019d just destroy everything. By the same token he could be destroyed himself if he just ate up the day. When it started to get really light, he started to get uneasy. Then the manor lord, Hjelmslev, came riding by on his way to church. Poul went out to him and told him how things stood concerning these five guys. \u201cWell, it's possible that it's nothing other than a way to trick us, but it might also be true. So if you\u2019ll treat me to a good meal, then I\u2019ll watch out for them, and if they come, I\u2019ll make up for it.\u201d You see, now they had to serve up a meal for the manor lord who was a really big eater, and they got busy with all the preparations. The only pork they had was a shoulder of pork, and he got eggs as well and he ate it all. Just as they were sitting there, right in the middle of the meal, the Dover church bell rang the last time, and as soon as it was done, the robbers began pounding on the door. Then the manor lord says, \u201cIt\u2019s annoying how eager they are, can\u2019t you tell them I\u2019m not done yet?\u201d Poul also talked to them but they didn\u2019t pay too much attention to him. \u201cWell, sit down for a little while by the door, for God\u2019s sake, I want to finish.\u201d Now they pounded again, but it was a little door and they couldn\u2019t really get at it, and he said that if they\u2019d wait just a second, he\u2019d open the door voluntarily. So, satisfied, they gave them a moment. Hjelmslev finished soon and then he got up from the table and took his saber and then said to Poul that he could open the door now, but they\u2019d better not come more than one at a time. Poul did just so, so that they only came through one at a time, and then the manor lord stood inside and chopped their heads off as they came in and kicked their bodies aside. They didn\u2019t suspect a thing, even though they thought that it took a while, but they didn\u2019t manage to warn each other when they first had gotten inside, because then it was immediately kaput. When the last one had been killed, the manor lord said, \u201cNow I\u2019ve made up for the meal.\u201d From that time on, the church has been called Dover church, and the place where the robbers were killed has been called the Hjelmslev ground. It was a smallholding and now it\u2019s a house which is called the Hjelmslev house.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["afraid", "attention", "barn", "bed", "bells", "body", "bread", "bucket", "cattle", "chair", "chase", "church", "day", "death", "debt", "disappearance", "door", "drowning", "egg", "evening", "farm", "farmhand", "favor", "girl", "god", "heath", "hjelmslev", "horse", "house", "kill", "Klaus", "land", "manor lord", "Maundy Thursday", "meal", "misfortune", "morning", "name", "night", "outside", "Paul", "peasantry", "pond", "poor", "pork", "pot", "Poul", "riding", "robber", "rope", "seven", "shoulder", "sleep", "son", "strength", "suspect", "swear", "sword", "table", "trickery", "vagabond", "wagon", "water", "week", "window", "wound"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "R\u00f8vere, drabsm\u00e6nd og tyve", "heading_english": "Robbers, murderers and thieves"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
