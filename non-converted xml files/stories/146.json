Skytte-Kr\u00e6n [Hunter Christian] is likely of much humbler origins than the merchant and innkeeper. He is quite possibly a cunning man, given both his nickname and the role he plays in this story (DS VII 144).\n\n    In related stories, manor lords are accused of having a pact with Satan (BJK 1.15; PJ 3.08).  There are also many stories in which the minister's wife's is revealed to be a witch (DS VII 149). In all these cases, the goal is to link the economically well-off or the politically powerful with the devil and, in so doing, undermine the legitimacy of their social and economic standing.\n\n     The accusation of witchcraft lost most legal power by the nineteenth century. By 1866 it was no longer possible to try someone in court for witchcraft (Johansen 1991, 25; Tangherlini 2000). The standard for proving an accusation of witchcraft was generally quite high, even during the seventeenth century when witchcraft trials were at a peak (Tangherlini 2000; Johansen 1991; Henningsen 1975). Changing shape from dog to human and back would likely have reached that standard. The black dog is a common shape for the devil and, given the close connection between the devil and witches, it is not hard to imagine a witch in dog form (Woods 1959; Valk 2001). Kristen Nielsen from Mosehuse, for example, also tells a variant in which the witch appears as a dog (DS VII 144). Otherwise, common animal shapes for the witch to assume are cats and hares (DS VII 141 and 145).\n\n     The power of naming as a form of control over the supernatural is a widely attested belief. Naming the witch is closely linked to other stories in which the witch's identity is brought to light (DS VII 149). In numerous other stories, naming the witch leads to the same type of transformation found in this story.
