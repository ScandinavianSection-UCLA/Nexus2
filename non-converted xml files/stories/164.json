Unlike his other stories about horse dealers traveling with large sums of money, this horse dealer would have been better off on the road than the seeming safety of the inn (JPP 2.01 and 2.02). Melting lead into the ears of a sleeping guest is widely attested as a presumably undetectable method for murder (DS IV 1407). Other methods include driving a nail through the ear of a sleeping person (DS IV 1405 and 1406). Murder will out, and many legends attest to the surprising manner in which the ill deed is uncovered.", "danish_manuscript": "Paa en Kierkegaard her i Vendsyssel\nvil en graver kaste en Grav.
