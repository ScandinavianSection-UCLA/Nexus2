Despite numerous complaints against them, the Vinbl\u00e6sfolk (Vinbl\u00e6s people) were never subjected to anything more than fines for quacksalvery because their patients vouched for them, and the local physicians had agreed to leave them in peace (R\u00f8rbye 1976, 106).\n\n     Even though the son in this story dies, the Vindbl\u00e6s woman's powers are confirmed through her accurate prediction of the baker's death. Although the ability to predict accurately someone's death might have led to accusations of witchcraft in an earlier time, historical changes and, perhaps more importantly, the Vindbl\u00e6s woman's considerable status in the surrounding area, would have allowed her to easily beat any such accusation (Tangherlini 2000).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var nogle flere fra Nielstrup ude \nved hende en G. x s. kom der en R\u00e6kke Vogne\nkj\u00f8rende gjennem Vindbl\u00e6s og skulde til Kj\u00f8b-\nstadeb.
