The opening is somewhat tentative, but Jens quickly finds his rhythm.\n\n     The girl--presumably also a kidnap victim--acts the role of the magical helper, and helps the knight defeat the otherwise overwhelming force of robbers. The helpful girl resonates with the previous story of the three good pieces of advice (BJK 3.05). The old hag in this story is perhaps most akin to a witch, although she has no overtly supernatural powers. \n\n     Although the bet is for one thousand dj\u00e6vler, or devils, it is quite likely that Tang Kristensen misheard--daler would be a more likely thing to wager.\n\n     Interestingly, the knight marries neither of the damsels in distress, and instead arranges a marriage for the first girl with one of his colleagues.\n\n     Other stories of robbers that include a robber named Daniel usually single him out for being the worst of all (JPP 2.10). In an interesting twist, this Daniel is quite helpful, and is rewarded with ownership of the fort for his assistance.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var en Ridder, der kom til saadan et\nenligt Sted.

I think that he'd been in league with some people there in the forest and had fled from them. Then he wanted to go in there and hide and stay there the night. Then he sees an old hag who is standing there with a young woman and is putting a necklace on her neck and she said that she had a pain in her neck. It hurt in the front and it hurt in the back and it was a horrible pain she had. This young woman was then to come and serve him and she wrote on the table, look out for me, I'm going to come again, and she served him with wine that had a sleeping potion in it but she threw it down onto the ground and then she said: That's right, my lord, drink it all, we have more. It pleased her, that he would drink so much. Everything so that the hag wouldn't notice anything. She gave him a note explaining how everything was to go. Then he settled down and he put a dead body in the bed. Then when they'd come home, the old hag was to light a light for them. Then the master of the fort who'd opened up for him, came and he was to stab him to death, but then the knight was standing behind the door with his sword drawn. When they came home, they'd taken a maiden in the forest, they had gotten a hold of her and she was his sweetheart, and then they'd eaten and gotten so drunk that it was frightening. The old hag's son had always had the first girl as a night friend, but now he wanted to have the new one instead. He bet 1000 devils with each one over who was to have her, the one felt he had more right to her than the next.

He went in there and shoved his dagger into him. That was well placed, said the old hag, it made such a deep \"oh\" sound. Then the knight came out and chopped off the head first of the fort master and then the hag but he didn't harm the girl.

Then she called to him, he should come. When he came he put the sword right up to his chest, but didn't harm him. He said that now the holy woman [saved him] had kept her word, because he'd dreamed that a holy woman had saved him from this prison. Then he took a chair and broke the back off of it and went with that and killed all of them, because they were all so drunk. When he'd killed the fort master and the hag, he had gone to a place where the lord was, and he heard from inside there a hoarse woman's voice say: Yes, you have my life but you will never get my honor.
