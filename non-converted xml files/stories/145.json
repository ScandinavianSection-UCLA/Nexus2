Her request for milk borders on begging which, according to the reforms to the poverty assistance laws in 1803, was strictly forbidden. On the other hand, poverty assistance, in the form of in kind almisse (alms), were an important part of the support for the poor, and many poor people did receive milk from farmers throughout the parish, either as part of an agreement with the parish poverty administration, or through private agreement (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 316). Karen's request for milk can be read as a symbolic representation of the ongoing request for support of the poor that many smallholders and farmers found to be a significant economic burden. The refusal to give St\u00f8v-Karen milk is explained in a later telling of this story: the husband will only eat milk-fed veal (JPP 4.14). The refusal is not based on the need to keep the farm functioning well, but rather to provide a luxury to the farm owner while the poor go hungry (or in this case, without milk).\n\n     St\u00f8v-Karen, whose nickname means \"Dust Karen,\" acts the part of a witch in this story. In other stories, she is referred to as a cunning woman (JPP 1.06) (R\u00f8rbye 1976; Tangherlini 2000). Her reaction to the initial refusal--bewitching the new calf so that it jumps about the barn--is extreme, and the death of the calf results in a far greater economic burden than her request for milk. Bewitching cows, or otherwise hurting the livestock, is a common antic of witches (DS VII 1179 and 1183). \n\n     The arrogance that Karen exhibits when she returns to the farm to collect milk is evident in the pitcher that she brings with her. While many poor might ask for a small pot of milk, Karen intends to walk off with an entire milk can, far more than a single person could hope to use before it would spoil, and reminiscent of the excessive supernatural milking described in other legends of witches (DS VII 591 and 592).\n\n     The farmer decides to confront the witch directly and beat her, as opposed to appealing to another intermediary such as a cunning person (DS VII 1180) or a minister (DS VII 574), strategies which tend to be effective, at least in narrative tradition (Tangherlini 1999). Not all ministers were willing to act as mediators (DS VII 176). The threat is not successfully mediated in this story and ultimately the farmer acquiesces to Karen's demands in an attempt to keep her witchcraft at bay. Her ability to change shape, in this case into a dark bird of prey, confirms that she is a witch.\n\n     After the rise of the collective dairies in the 1880s, many of the poor found that they no longer could count on getting milk from local farmers, as the dairies collected the milk each morning. In the seven short years following the establishment of the first cooperative dairy in 1882, six hundred additional cooperative dairies were established, primarily in Jutland. The result was that there was little or no excess milk production for the poor (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 316).\n\n     Tang Kristensen reversed the order of certain phrases in the story's orientation in the published version. He also added the tag that Jens Peter's mother was at the farm when the episode with the calf occurred, a tag that actually appears on page 6193a at the end of a story about some sheep that had disappeared (JPP 1.06).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand der hed Kristian Sten-\nbroen i Stenbroen i Taars, syd for\nBorup.
