Often, she is in league with the devil or, in less extreme cases, scandalous in her behavior (DS VII 149). Calling her \"Mr. Dorrit\" is, of course, derogatory. By contrast, her husband, the minister, is described as a man of great virtue.\n\n     The preservation of the minister's corpse after \"Mr. Dorrit\" plagues him to death is reminiscent of the miraculous preservation of the incorruptible bodies of Catholic saints, such as St. Bernadette. The minister's seeming animation after death would usually be seen as a form of haunting but, here, because of his virtue, is seen in a positive light. Certain beliefs closely linked to Catholicism, such as belief in incorruptible bodies and ghosts, continued to be expressed in storytelling despite the Reformation and the strong influence of the Lutheran church in everyday life. \n\n     In the published version, Tang Kristensen moved the place name reference to Voldum from KMP 1.06, and printed the two stories together, jumping over KMP 1.05 which he published as a separate story.", "danish_manuscript": "Der ver en Pr\u00e6stekone der hed Hr.
