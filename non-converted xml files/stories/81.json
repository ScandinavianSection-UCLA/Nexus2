Here, the tailor is described as unusually shy around women to the extent that he even refuses to measure them.\n\n     Labeling the tailor a beggar is somewhat unfair, since his possession of the poor board indicates clearly that his assistance was being supervised by the local authorities.   Prior to reforms in the poverty assistance laws in 1803, the most common form of care for the poor was \"omgangsfors\u00f8rgelsen\" [revolving assistance]. Under this system, a person was assigned to a series of farms, and they would go from one farm to the next listed on their stakkelsfj\u00e6l (poor board) to receive help  (J\u00f8rgensen 1940 (1979), 10-11). After the land reforms of the late 1780s and the subsequent physical relocation of farms out onto the newly apportioned fields, the system was no longer sustainable since the distances between farms had become quite large. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, revolving assistance had been replaced by direct assistance, both in kind and monetary assistance, and the establishment of poor houses and, later, poor farms.\n\n   \n     The lengths to which Hjorde-Jens and then Truukr\u00e6n go to avoid paying for the tailor's burial are morbidly comical. In that sense, the story parallels folktales in which corpses are posed to look like the living (PJ 1.02).The cost of burying those receiving poor help accrued to the local parish board, and not to the individual farmer who happened to be housing the person at the time of their death (J\u00f8rgensen 1940). The story is apocryphal: since Jens apparently knew Truukr\u00e6n, the events described here cannot have happened earlier than the 1820s, even though the system of assistance described here ended in the first decades of the century (J\u00f8rgensen 1940, 11).\n\n     The manuscript makes no distinction between the preceding story and this one. In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen changed the order of events, describing the tailor's death first. He also editorialized on Jens's performance of the story, noting: \"It was quite funny to hear my informant pronounce the tailor's Jutish sentences, since he comes from \u00c5restrup and always uses \"w\" in his speech, used \"v\" here to make it clear that the tailor was from Rold, where they use that sound.\" Although Tang Kristensen was primarily commenting on differences in local pronunciation, he inadvertently provided helpful information concerning the performance of the story. Because of this note, one can more easily imagine Jens switching voices and even speech patterns as he told the story, particularly when relating direct speech.", "danish_manuscript": "Naar en Tigger havde gaaet \nher i Byen omkring og kr\u00e6vet, s. skulde de kj\u00f8re\ndem til n\u00e6rmeste By.

Each town had their own \"poor board.\" There was an old tailor from Rold who died at our neighbor's house, and the man who lived in the farm to the west he was an alderman. Now, the town in which he died had to pay for his burial. The tailor was the brother of the parish bailiff in Rold, and he went around sewing for people, but by the end he just went about begging, they called him the Rold Tailor, he was shy around women. At one place, he was sitting on the table sewing and the children were standing on the floor rocking a baby, while their mother was out milking at the moment, and they tipped over the cradle and it landed on top of the baby. But the tailor wasn't man enough to go over and help the little baby up, because it was a girl. When the mother came back in she said, \"Couldn't you have done the baby a favor and picked the cradle up, it could have lain there and suffocated?\" But he answered, \"Nah, I won't mess with that shit, no sirree. If that shit had been a boy, then it would have been a totally different story.\" Kold-Jen's old mother wanted him to sew a dress for her, and she wanted him to measure her. But he answered, \"Get out of here, I can make it fit you.\" She wanted it to be a bit nice and pretty and she stood and wriggled her shoulders. But he said, \"Get out of here,\" and he didn't want to touch her. He could get all the town's dogs to follow along behind him in a line and he patted them and called out to them, \"Are you coming over here, my friend, you are my only friend in the world. Do you remember the time I helped you out when you'd stolen all those wonderful herrings, I knew it, but I didn't say anything.\" Then he lay there and died at Hjorde-Jens's, and then he went over to Old Per, that was his neighbor, and he got him to help him carry him out and they placed him up next to a stone wall that was pretty tall, and tied his bag on him, and put his staff in his hand. It was early in the morning, before dawn. When daylight came, Hjorde-Jens came out and found him there and went over to the alderman, they called him Truukr\u00e6n, and told him that. \"Well,\" he says, \"that's really bad,\" and he told his farmhand that he should harness the two gray horses to a dung wagon and go over and get him and then they drove him over to Rold over to the parish bailiff's farm. \"I've brought your brother,\" said Truukr\u00e6n, \"he's dead.\" Well, then they could take him with them again, and bury him. But then Truukr\u00e6n jumped off the wagon and took hold of the one dung board and Byrri-Niels took hold of the other, and then they dumped the tailor out of the wagon with his bag, and his basket and his things, and he fell down onto the ground, and then they jumped back up into the wagon and rode off. When they got to Tryss\u00f8, they could hear that they were beating on the drum in Rold, they were going to gather and talk about what they should do with the tailor.", "danish_publication": "N\u00e5r en tigger havde g\u00e5et byen her omkring og kr\u00e6vet ind, s\u00e5 skulde folkene kj\u00f8re ham til n\u00e6rmeste by, og det skulde den, der havde \"stakkelsfj\u00e6len\".

If a beggar died on his wanderings, his burial had to be paid for by the town in which he died.
