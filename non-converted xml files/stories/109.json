Personal property and personal initiative to prosecute torts had become concerns of people far down the social ladder; prior to these reforms, few people had any real or personal property to protect. The rogue's clever reply to the claimants, both in the first case and in the second case (against the minister), clearly form the narrative crux of these accounts. This emphasis on oratorical skill appears frequently in Jens's stories.\n\n     The second part of the story dealing with the falling out between the minister and the rogue, and the subsequent court case, incorporates an element of sex--something that appears frequently in many of Jens's other stories and songs. The rogue's initial criticism of the minister and his stupidity, comparing him to the horse for slipping into a \"hole\", leads to their confrontation in court. There, the rogue plays the minister for a fool, relying again on double entendres and imprecise information to score a rhetorical victory.\n\n     The recording in the manuscript is confusing. For the sake of readability, I have marked the section that actually appears at the end of the manuscript record in brackets. It is unclear why Tang Kristensen began writing half-way down the page (4107a). It is possible that Jens decided to explain the underlying cause for the libel case between the minister and the rogue by telling the story of the minister's seduction and then returning to the story of the case.", "danish_manuscript": "Skalken fra Mjels var en Gaardmand der\nH. reddede deres Pr\u00e6st en G. h. skulde have\ngivet en stor Kapital en G.

He saved their minister, when he was to pay a huge amount of money (stor Kapital). He'd attended the Latin school in Aalborg, and one time he'd gone into a restaurant and had eaten three eggs that he hadn't paid for. This was left unresolved until he was minister in Ferslev and a bill came for the three eggs... three chickens could have laid so many eggs ... and so on until it was a bill so big that the minister couldn't pay it. He had no idea what he should do, and was in really bad straits. He'd been summoned for it. Then the rogue says he could meet up for him and then he'd set things in order. The minister thought this was great. Travels off to Aalborg. He is supposed to appear at a certain time but he he doesn't, he waits a half hour longer. Is he the one who was to meet up for the minister. Yes, he was. Why did he wait so long? Yes, please excuse him, he had a barrel of boiled peas and he absolutely had to get them planted. \"What? Cooked peas can't grow.\" \"Oh yeah.\" They began reading up the case to him. \"Permission to ask a question, weren't the eggs prepared, boiled or fried?\" Yes, they were boiled. \"You said that boiled peas couldn't grow, how could you get chicks from boiled eggs?\" Yes, they had to admit that that couldn't happen. Well you're welcome to reach an agreement with the minister, because otherwise they'd have him to deal with. So they had to give money to the minister instead. Then a while passed and he and the minister were great friends, but then they had a falling out, him and the minister. But the rogue was the rogue and he made himself so deathly ill, and the minister was sent for to give him the last rites. Then the minister asks if he has something on his conscience and it would be for the best ... Yes he did, he had taken life from his first wife. Lord save us. Had he done anything else? Yes, he had screwed seven dogs to death. The minister heard him out. Then he got better, the rogue did, and then they were going to start their case. The rogue was a fine upstanding person and he'd [never hurt anyone. \"What did you admit to me when you were sick?\" Yes, he hadn't done anything to be ashamed over. The minister continued to prod him and then he says it. It was really bad weather and his wife was going to deliver, but they couldn't get a midwife, and so he did it himself. So that was the life he'd taken. Then there were these dogs. His dog had had seven puppies and they lay under the bed. Then he'd fucked his wife and the bottom of the bed had fallen out, and they had crushed all the puppies to death. That's what had happened. The minister wasn't supposed to make this public and so he lost his position because of that. He proved to the judge that the nag was wiser than the minister too and the judge agreed with him.] The minister had seduced one of his hired girls and had gotten into bad difficulties to avoid being called Father.

Det stod saa hen, til han var bleven Pr\u00e6st i Ferslev. Da kom der en Regning til ham paa de tre \u00c6g, og der stod, at der af de tre \u00c6g kunde v\u00e6re kommet tre Kyllinger, og de kunde have lagt saa mange \u00c6g, og saadan blev de ved at stille det frem, til det blev en Regning saa stor, at Pr\u00e6sten han kunde ikke betale den.

Ja, de maatte have ham undskyldt, han havde en T\u00f8nde kogte \u00c6rter, og dem skulde han absolut have saaet. \"Hvad? kogte \u00c6rter de kan jo ikke gro\", og de begyndte at l\u00e6se op for ham. \"Mig Tilladelse at sp\u00f8rge\", siger han saa, \"var de \u00c6g ikke kogte eller stegte eller lavede til?\" Jo, de var kogte. \"De sagde, at kogte \u00c6rter kunde ikke gro, hvordan kan der da blive Kyllinger af kogte \u00c6g?\" Ja, det maatte de tilstaa, der kunde heller ikke. Saa fik de v\u00e6re saa god at gj\u00f8re Forlig med Pr\u00e6sten, sagde Skalken, for ellers fik de med ham at bestille. De maatte saa til at give Pr\u00e6sten Penge i Stedet for at faa. Det stod nu hen en Tid, og han og Pr\u00e6sten var store Venner. Men saa kom de i Ustand. Skalken var jo Skalken, og han gjorde sig saa d\u00f8delig syg, og Pr\u00e6sten blev hentet og skulde berette ham til D\u00f8den. Saa sp\u00f8rger Pr\u00e6sten, om han havde noget paa Samvittigheden, for saa var det bedst, han fik den lettet og fortalte ham det. Ja, han havde, han havde taget Livet af hans f\u00f8rste Kone.

Aaret efter red han den samme Vej paa det samme \u00d8g, og da kunde han ikke komme n\u00e6r om ved det hul. Saa sagde han, at \u00d8get var klogere end deres Pr\u00e6st. Det fik Pr\u00e6sten at h\u00f8re, og saa sags\u00f8gte han ham for det. Da de skal nu til at begynde deres Proces, saa siger Skalken, at han havde aldrig gjort ham nogen Fortr\u00e6d eller sagt nogen L\u00f8gn om ham. \"Hvad har du da bekjendt for mig, da du var syg?\" Ja, han havde ikke gjort noget, han beh\u00f8vede at skamme sig ved. Pr\u00e6sten bliver ved at praje ham, og han siger saa, hvordan det har sig.  Det var saa forf\u00e6rdelig ondt Vejr, og hans Kone Skulde gj\u00f8re Barsel, men de kunde ikke faa Jordemoder, og saa gjorde han det selv ud. Det var det Liv, han havde taget. Det var nu det, men saa begynder Pr\u00e6sten at tale om den anden Forbrydelse, han havde begaaet. Hans hund havde faaet Syv hvalpe, og de laa under Sengen. Saa havde han en Nat ...... hans Kone, og da Slap Bunden af Sengen, og de havde klemt alle hvalpene ihjel. Saadan var det gaaet til. Saa maa Pr\u00e6sten til at tage fat paa den Beskyldning, at hans gamle \u00d8g var klogere end Pr\u00e6sten. Ja, Skalken begynder saa med at fort\u00e6lle, at han var saadan et oprigtigt Menneske, og nu var han da n\u00f8dt til at fort\u00e6lle det, som det var. Pr\u00e6sten havde lokket en af hans piger og var kommen i en slem Forlegenhed for at blive fri for at kaldes Faaer. Men Aaret efter lokkede han Pigen anden Gang.
