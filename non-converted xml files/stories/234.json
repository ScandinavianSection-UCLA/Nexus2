During the land reforms of the late eighteenth century, and with the partitioning of farms and the recovery of heath through the nineteenth century, land surveyors were kept busy. Numerous legends tell of corrupt land surveyors who did not draw proper boundary lines or otherwise engaged in dishonest surveying, often at the instigation of a party to the survey (DS V 1443, 1484). Such dishonesty was often repaid in the afterlife when the land surveyor was forced to haunt (DS V 1477, 1507). Pentika\u00efnen classifies such haunts as guilty haunts (1969). In this story, as in the story of the black dog, neither the young boy nor the grandmother make any contact with the haunts, and the haunts simply disappear.\n\n     The distance from Halling to Nielstrup, following roads, is approximately 6.2 kilometers.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Bedstemoder gik en g. fra Halling og til\nNielstrup hvor hu boede, havde set til en \nSl\u00e6gtning der i Halling.
