In some stories she is maliciously inclined toward the community (a witch), and in other stories, she is a clear protector of the community and its economic interests (a cunning person). \n\n     In this account, St\u00f8v-Karen is clearly working in the interests of the community. With her bell, she is able to \"show again,\" a skill of the cunning folk (KMP 1.56 and 1.57; AMJ 1.06 and 2.07). Although the sheep have not been stolen, but rather simply strayed, having them returned is of considerable importance. In another variant, St\u00f8v-Karen indicates that she is helping out because she likes the shepherd boy (JPP 4.14).\n\n     This variant was not published. Instead, Tang Kristensen published a more elaborate series of stories about St\u00f8v-Karen that he collected from Jens Peter when he visited him for the fourth time (JPP 4.14). In the coda, Jens Peter connects this story to his earlier story about the bewitched calf (JPP 1.04). Interestingly, Tang Kristensen included the statement about Jens's mother being present in the published version of JPP 1.04.\n\n     The location of Vugdrup (Vogdrup) is unclear. It might be the name of a farm, or of a small grouping of houses that later disappeared after the sale or dissolution of the small holdings.", "danish_manuscript": "I Vester Vogdrup var deres Faar henne [om]\ni 5 Dage.
