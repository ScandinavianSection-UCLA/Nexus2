The hiding place--a nearby mound--calls to mind stories about mound dwellers, yet Daniel shares none of their characteristics, apart from the fact that he is a threat to the community. Other local variants of the story provide additional detail about Daniel's exploits, the location of his hide-out, and his final punishment (DS IV 1591, 1593). In one variant, he is referred to as St\u00e6rke-Ole (DS IV 1594).\n\n    Daniel's threat to the community is immediate and overwhelming. Not only does he threaten the economy of the community but also the physical well-being of everyone in it, including the children. \n\n    Numerous stories tell of the supernatural benefits of eating the hearts of children: extraordinary strength or the ability to make oneself invisible (DS IV 1588). The murder and ingestion of the most vulnerable members of the community for personal gain underscore the extraordinary threat represented by Daniel.\n\n    Punishment for murder was death, and execution by beheading was in force up until 1933. Executions were public events up through much of the nineteenth century although, by the 1890s, executions were held at prisons, with only prison officials present (Steensberg 1964, vol. 2, 345-347).", "danish_manuscript": "Daniel boede i en H\u00f8j \u00f8sten for Ugilt\nKirke paa s\u00f8nder side af Vejen til Lin-\nderum.
