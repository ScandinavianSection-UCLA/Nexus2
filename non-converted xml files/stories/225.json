Rather than describing the actual conjuring, Kirsten Marie describes the aftermath. The pole marking the spot where Dorrit was conjured serves as a constant reminder to the threat she posed to the functioning of the household, particularly the well being of the hired girls. It is fitting, then, that the spirit is conjured in the storage cellar. While Dorrit's threat is greatly diminished, it is still possible that she will return.\n\nThe published version conflates this manuscript recording with KMP 1.04.\n", "danish_manuscript": "Dorrit var s. slem og s.\n[ble] gik hu igjen og blev manet.

Hun havde B\u00f8rn med Niels Brun, og de var saa slemme baade Dorrit og B\u00f8rnene ved Lavst, saa han kunde slet ikke bj\u00e6rge sig for dem. En Dag, da han stod paa Pr\u00e6kestolen i Rude Kirke, sagde han Farvel til hans Sognebeboere. Han sagde, te Vorherre i Himlen skulde tage ham nu, for han kunde ikke v\u00e6re paa Jorden l\u00e6ngere for hans Kone og hans Stifb\u00f8rn. Saa d\u00f8de han ogsaa lige efter og kom altsaa ikke paa Pr\u00e6kestolen mere. Men han laa i 15 Aar i hans Kiste med hans r\u00f8de Kinder.
