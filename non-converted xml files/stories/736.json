Mange havde set lys p\u00e5 N\u00f6rholts mark, og det var en almindelig tale, at her var en skat begravet. De to m\u00e6nd havde tit talt om, at de vilde gj\u00f8re et fors\u00f8g p\u00e5 at finde den, og en aften skulde da den ene st\u00e5 i N\u00f6rholts g\u00e5rd, medens den anden gik efter lyset, og s\u00e5 bl\u00e6se i en fl\u00f6jte, n\u00e5r han n\u00e5ede det, ti lyset forsvandt for den, der n\u00e6rmede sig, men skinnede lige klart for den, som stod i afstand. Niels Brovang gik s\u00e5 med en stok i h\u00e5nden, og da han h\u00f8rte fl\u00f6jten, stak han stokken i jorden. Kort efter kom Niels N\u00f6rholt og hans pige med spader og skovle, og s\u00e5 grov de med stor iver. Endelig st\u00f6dte de mod noget h\u00e5rdt, og det viste sig at v\u00e6re l\u00e5get af en kasse. Den ene sprang nu ned og fik fat i en l\u00e5dden hund. Af skr\u00e6k vilde han straks have l\u00f8bet sin vej, men pigen var mere modig, hun tog sit t\u00f6rkl\u00e6de af hovedet og bredte p\u00e5 gr\u00e6sset, l\u00f8ste sit forkl\u00e6de af og greb om hunden med. S\u00e5 sagde den, da hun havde lagt den p\u00e5 t\u00f6rkl\u00e6det: \"Fordi du tog mig s\u00e5 godt og lagde mig s\u00e5 bl\u00f6dt, skal du have lov til at tage skatten.\" Nu gik hun atter ned i hullet og fik fat p\u00e5 en kande s\u00e5 tung, at hun n\u00e6ppe kunde l\u00f8fte den op. Derefter lagde hun igjen hunden p\u00e5 sin plads, og de kastede hullet til. Da de kom hjem, viste det sig, at kanden var fuld af guldm\u00f8nter. S\u00e5 delte begge g\u00e5rdm\u00e6ndene dem imellem sig og gav pigen en lille sum for hendes udviste mod.", "english_publication": "The farms N\u00f8rholt and Brovang are in Skj\u00e6rn parish. Many people had seen a light on N\u00f8rholt\u2019s fields, and it was common knowledge that there was a treasure buried there. Two men had often talked about making an attempt at finding it and one night one of them was supposed to stand in the courtyard of N\u00f8rholt farm while the other went after the light, and then the one in the courtyard was to blow a whistle when the one walking toward the light reached it, since the light disappeared for the person who approached it, but burned just as clearly for the person who stood at a distance. Niels Brovang went with a staff in his hand and when he heard the whistle he planted the staff in the ground. A little after Niels N\u00f8rholt and his hired girl came with spades and shovels, and they began digging with great energy. Finally they banged into something hard, and it turned out to be the cover of a chest. One of them jumped down now and got hold of a shaggy dog. He wanted to run away out of shear fright, but the girl was more courageous, she took her scarf off her head and spread it on the grass, took off her apron and grabbed the dog with it. Then it said, when she had laid it on the scarf: \u201cBecause you took me so well and laid me down so softly, you shall have permission to take the treasure.\" Now she went down into the hole again and took hold of a pitcher that was so heavy that she barely could lift it up. When they got home, it turned out that the pitcher was full of gold coins. Then the two farmers split it amongst themselves and gave the girl a small sum for her hitherto unknown courage.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["apron", "banging", "blow", "burial", "chest", "coins", "courage", "courtyard", "digging", "disappearance", "dog", "farm", "farmer", "field", "girl", "gold", "grass", "home", "Niels", "Niels Brovang", "night", "parish", "permission", "scarf", "shaggy", "shovel", "spade", "treasure", "whistle"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Sagn om skatte", "heading_english": "Legends about treasure"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
