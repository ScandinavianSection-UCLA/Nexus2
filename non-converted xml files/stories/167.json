The minister dares not spend the night in the church, and the volunteer agrees to sit vigil, as it were, in exchange for a considerable economic reward, in this case a cow. It is worth noting that the Lutheran church prohibited the practice of sitting vigil after the Reformation.\n\n     The brave person is often a poor cobbler (DS V 860). The devil notes the underlying fiscal motivation driving the cobbler's bravery. The cobbler counters that he is simply engaged in normal economic activity--the making of a pair of shoes.\n\n     Sitting under the church bell, rather than inside a circle, is also attested as efficacious against the threat of the revenant or the devil (DS V 864). Irrespective of where the brave person sits, the threat is directed at the sanctity of the church itself and by extension the very center of the community. \n\n     Jens Peter's story resolves positively both for the community, which gets the church back, and for the cobbler, whose economic fortune increases greatly.", "danish_manuscript": "I Torslev Kirke var det s. galt med Sp\u00f8-\ngeri og skidt.
