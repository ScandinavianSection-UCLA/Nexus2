Interestingly, it is a parish clerk who consults a cunning person for the remedy. In many Danish legends, a parallel is drawn between cunning folk and parish clerks, in large part because of their subordinate relationship to parish ministers (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n     In Danish folk belief, the mare is a woman who rides on a person's chest while he is asleep (Tillhagen 1960 and 1981; Raudvere 1993). Victims of the mare are predominantly male. The person who is plagued by a mare wakes up exhausted, and may eventually die (PJ 3.04).\n\n     There are numerous remedies and spells for keeping a mare away from houses and also from animals (Raudvere 1993). In contrast to remedies for the mare, Kirsten Marie's remedy seems to be related either to birthing, given the fact that those spells often rely on sympathetic magic, or to modsot, an unspecified wasting disease. Cures for modsot often included measuring the patient (DS VII 1612).Tang Kristensen clearly believed the spell was related to this last category given his placement of the story in Danske sagn in a section with other cures for modsot and similar wasting diseases.\n\n     The distance from Rud to Stubdrup is approximately one kilometer. In the published variant, Tang Kristensen made a transcription error and located the parish clerk in Rude, rather than in Rud, many kilometers to the south. Borup is approximately twenty-two kilometers north of Rud and just north of Randers.", "danish_manuscript": "Morkorset. Mor.
