The elaborate taxonomies that some scholars propose to differentiate between supernatural beings is hard to reconcile with stories such as this one. Although the tradition dominant for the story proposes mound dwellers, Peder clearly chooses the more seductive female elves to fulfill the motifemic slot of supernatural threat. Svend Felding proves himself more clever than the elves, managing to get both his wish and the drinking chalice. Peder makes no mention of what becomes of the drinking chalice. In other variants of the story, the chalice is used to build a church--the theft from the supernatural outsiders is made acceptable since the proceeds are not used for personal gain, but rather for the good of the community (Ball 2009; DS I 818). Felding was a well known figure in local legends (DS I 960; DS I 962). His enormous appetite offers an amusing contrast to the equally strong nisse who survives on a bowl of porridge that he receives but once a year (AMJ 2.16).\n\n     The expression \"snild i Bygning\" is somewhat ambiguous. It has been translated here as \"good at building,\" but it can also be translated as \"really well built\", in which case the elves do not want him for his abilities but rather for his body.", "danish_manuscript": "Svend Felding h. var f\u00f8dt paa Aakj\u00e6r og\nblev bosiddende der som M. og h. var s.\ngrov snild i Bygning, s.
