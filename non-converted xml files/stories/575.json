As he was lying there in the bed, with his head resting on one side, the farmer's wife goes and puts a ladle they had on the fire and melts lead in it and pours the lead down in his ear. He dies and is buried, and they keep the things the peddler had. It goes like this for a while, and then the grave is dug up again. The gravedigger puts the head aside, because it was so heavy and he could see the lead in the head. He tells the minister about it, and the minister asks people if anyone could remember who had been buried there. Then there was a really old woman, she says that in such and such a farm, a peddler had gotten lodgings, and he had died suddenly that night. Then the minister asks if anyone from that farm who was there when the peddler had come was still alive. Yes, the woman was still alive, she was a pensioner. The minister wrapped the skull in a scarf and then he followed along with a couple of men out there. When they come in, he asks her if she didn't know that head. Well, she confessed immediately and explained the whole event and how she'd done it. Then she was driven to Aalborg and put in the courthouse. The next morning she was dead, but how she'd died, there were no questions about that.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["bed", "burial", "confession", "court", "death", "digging", "ear", "farm", "farmer", "fire", "grave", "lodgings", "minister", "morning", "night", "old", "peddler", "pensioner", "rest", "scarf", "skull", "wife", "woman", "wound"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "R\u00f8vere, drabsm\u00e6nd og tyve", "heading_english": "Robbers, murderers and thieves"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
