In almost all cases, the giant tries to knock over the local church steeple, perhaps because the ringing of the bells disturbs him, perhaps because the encroachment of Christianity, as marked by the church building, threatens his territory. Although the giant's throw most often comes up short, here he overthrows. These stories are considered to be \"etiological\" as they explain the existence of an unusually large stone in the landscape, often marked by the giant's hand. \n\n     Denmark is a deeply glaciated landscape. Retreating glaciers from the last ice age littered the fertile soil with enormous rocks, known as glacial erratics. These erratics exhibit both striation, revealing the direction of the glacier's movement, and other types of fragmentation, that can lead to unusual patterns on their surface. Although originally buried in the silt and soil left by the glacier, these rocks are uncovered through normal processes of erosion.", "danish_manuscript": "Der ligger en Sten paa Kirketange s\u00f8nden \nfor Aarestrup og den har en K\u00e6mpe staaet\npaa R\u00e6vild K\u00e5ld og vild ha slaaet Aarestr\nKirke ned med.
