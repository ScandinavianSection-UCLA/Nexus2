Det var i en stormnat, havet gik s\u00e5 h\u00f6jt, at der var fare for, at b\u00e5dene, der var trukne meget h\u00f6jt op p\u00e5 stranden, skulde blive revne v\u00e6k.

Just before the person died, he uttered a curse that would affect his children, they would die suddenly just like he was dying now. That man had three sons, and they drowned in a storm at sea. The third one lived in Vrist and died in a similar manner. It was a stormy night, the sea was so high that there was a danger that the boats that had been dragged far up on the beach would be torn away. People wanted to pull them over the low cliffs and for that reason had to fill them with sand, because otherwise the wind would have taken them when they got them totally up. The man who we\u2019re talking about helped with one of the boats, but before it came up, the wind took it in such a way that he wound up under it and was crushed. A messenger was immediately sent to his farm and his wife came out and met the people who were carrying him home almost halfway. He was still alive but died shortly after.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["beach", "boat", "children", "cliff", "curse", "danger", "death", "drowning", "farm", "home", "island", "kill", "messenger", "night", "plunder", "sand", "sea", "son", "storm", "stranded", "three", "wife", "wind", "wound"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "R\u00f8vere, drabsm\u00e6nd og tyve", "heading_english": "Robbers, murderers and thieves"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
