He is more than cut down to size by the girl's relatives. Interestingly, the relatives are manor lords themselves and so the loss of the seven manor farms does not result in a redistribution of wealth to poorer layers of society. Instead the redistribution takes place within the same class. Similarly, the young girl is not from the class of his usual victims: the women he sleeps with and throws into the moat are clearly the children of day laborers and other leasehold farmers, and not the children of farm owners or aristocrats. Nevertheless, the cruelty of the manor lord leads to his demise. His sentence to wander about as a beggar calls to mind stories of the Wandering Jew and also acts as a form of narrative justice.\n\n     The dice game appears to be rigged, and thus the punishment of the Count relies on dishonesty. His wrongs are righted by the wrongs of the other manor lords--cruelty and barbarism are counteracted by dishonesty and immorality. Of course, fighting one inversion with another is a successful strategy in folk narrative to deal with outside threat.\n\n     Unlike his previous stories, Peder makes a point of emphasizing the truth of this narrative. \n\n     There is little difference between the manuscript and published version of the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Paa Gaarden Urup var der en Grev J\u00f8rgen, det\nvar en rig M. h. ejede 7 Herregaarde for-\nuden Urup og n\u00e6rensti h. kj\u00f8r i styv Stads\ns. havde h. 8 [for] hvide Hopper for.
