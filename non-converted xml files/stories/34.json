These short descriptions echo the detail he provided in his longer narratives that link his stories closely to the local area. \n\n     One of the major agricultural advances was large-scale drainage projects that allowed heath land to be put under plow. Along with mergling, a process in which marl was added to the soil in the heath, large areas of arable land became available for the establishment of small holdings. Jens's description of the vestiges of plowing near the swamp suggest that swamp was not the \"original\" state of the land. The story offers indirect support to the large-scale drainage projects that would return the swamp to its \"original\" state of arability.", "danish_manuscript": "Der er ogsaa en S\u00f8 her inde i N\u00f8rlund Skov\nde kalder Guds\u00f8s Mose og en lille S\u00f8 har der\nv\u00e6ret, udt\u00f8rret. der saa ogsaa ligesom der\nhavde v\u00e6ret pl\u00f8jet rundet omkring.", "english_manuscript": "There's also a lake here in N\u00f8rlund forest, they call it Guds\u00f8 Swamp (G\u00e5rds\u00f8 mose).
