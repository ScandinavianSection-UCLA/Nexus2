The distilling of spirits was a licensed undertaking limited to market towns. While licensed stills were common in towns, unlicensed rural stills were even more common (PJ 2.20). The unlicensed stills paid no taxes and therefore there was considerable pressure from the authorities to close them. In this short account of the controllers' visit, the farmwife confronts the problem in a time honored fashion: she uses her feminine charm and what amounts to a small bribe to distract the inspectors and keep the still operating. Other farmers apparently were not as lucky. \n\n     This story confirms the importance that Kirsten Marie's grandfather plays in her repertoire. The references are presumably to her maternal grandfather (Rasmus Christensen b. 1761), given other comments she makes about the sources of many of her stories (KMP 1.08, 1.10, 1.12, 1.29, 2.08 and 4.01).", "danish_manuscript": "I S\u00f8ndergaard i Nielstrup hvor min\nBedstefader var f\u00f8dt der kom Kontrol\nl\u00f8ren og der sp\u00e6ndte de fra.
