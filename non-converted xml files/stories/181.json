In Danske sagn, there are over two hundred stories about nisser (nisse, pl. nisser; household spirits). \n\n     The farmhand's fight with the nisse is ill-advised because, like most supernatural beings, the nisse is given to extreme reactions. Putting the farmhand onto the upturned blades of the harrow is reminiscent of the farmhand's treatment of the mare in Peder Johansen's story of a farmhand punishing the supernatural night mare (PJ 3.04). It is unclear what the sleep pin (s\u00f8vnbron = s\u00f8vnpr\u00f8nne or s\u00f8vnpryn, a slumber pin) that the nisse uses to put the farmhand to sleep is. Some stories suggest that a sleeping needle is a needle used to sew burial clothes and it can be used to put people into a magical slumber. The motif of a magical needle causing sleep is well known in European folklore, its best known manifestation being the spinning wheel spindle on which  Sleeping Beauty pricks her finger.\n\n     Jens Peter uses the less common term gaardbo for nisse. Gaardbo literally means \"something that lives at the farm.\" The name of the farm should be emended to read Hvidsted, a farm that figures in several of Jens Peter's stories (JPP 2.08, 2.09 and 2.13).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Gaardbo i Hvedsted. min\nModers Bedstemoder kunde huske ham.\nDa havde de Tr\u00e6grebe og Karlen h. gik\nog magte om Morg.
