Ultimately, the wise minister accepts the boy's claim, but only after he has substantial proof. Jens Peter gives no details as to how the wise minister kept the mound dwellers at bay later. The mound dwellers' eventual retreat from the district aligns well with stories of mound dwellers being driven away by church bells (JPP 4.09). Ironically, here they are attracted by bells--the supper bell.\n\n     It is interesting to note that, in Jens Peter's later sessions, he includes stories that occur at a much greater distance from his home than in earlier sessions. Horne, for instance, is seventeen kilometers north of Ilbjerge huse.

Well, he gets up again and nobody had seen him either because he had a hat on. Then he comes home driving the sheep that evening, they didn't know he'd been home. Then the people say to him, \"Why didn't you come home and have your lunch today?\" He was a real rough guy and he swore up and down he'd been there.

Then he understood how the food was never enough, and since the minister was a wise man, he made it so that they couldn't come and eat there any longer.
