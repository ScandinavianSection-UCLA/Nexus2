Hans fader var tr\u00e6skomand, og han har altid selv ern\u00e6ret sig derved. Da han blev s\u00e5 vildele, at han kunde magte det, gik han dog i h\u00f6stens tid ud p\u00e5 h\u00f8starbejde. Han var med i 1848-krigen, boede i mange \u00e5r i et hus i Ersted, det var der, jeg ops\u00f8gte ham, og for 5, 6 \u00e5r siden flyttede han ud nordvest for \u00c5restrup i Hovbakshusene. Hans fader ejede kun et lille hus til 1 ko og 5, 6 f\u00e5r. Sine viser har han l\u00e6rt af sin moder, men hun sang dem alle med \u00e9n tone.

His mother was from \u00c5restrup but his father was from Tveden. He has always lived here in the area, and he was only eight or nine years old when he had to start helping his father drill out clogs. His father was a clog maker and he has always lived off of doing that. When he got strong enough to handle it, Jens worked during harvest time with the harvest work. He took part in the war of 1848 and lived for many years in a house in Ersted, that is where I visited him, and five or six years ago he moved to the northwest of \u00c5restrup to Hovbakhusene (Hovbaks houses). His father owned but a small house with one cow and five or six sheep. He learned his ballads from his mother, but she sang them all to one melody. In contrast, the father was a good singer and he learned the melodies from him. He also knew some ballads. Jens has sung many a ballad with Johan Pingel, who was first a road worker and later a railroad guard over in Ellidsh\u00f8j. Jens calls everything that he tells a bunch of nonsense and not worth listening to, but no shame, he does not mean anything with it. His wife does not like all this old rubbish, and he does not like to open up in her presence. Luckily, she goes off to the neighbors with regularity. He is well attuned to the old mindset and the way the old people lived and he tells about it eagerly.\n      I have also been out to Johan Pingel, but regrettably he has forgotten far too much.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["ballad", "birth", "Bitte Jens", "clogs", "cow", "father", "harvest", "harvest time", "house", "Jens", "Jens Kristensen", "Johan Pingel", "learning", "mother", "neighbor", "nonsense", "northwest", "old", "railroad", "road", "shame", "sheep", "singing", "strength", "town", "war", "wife", "work", "worker"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Vore f\u00e6dres tankes\u00e6t og \u00e5ndsliv", "heading_english": "Our forebears' way of thinking and spiritual life"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": null}, "genre": null}
