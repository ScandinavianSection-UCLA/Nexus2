Jens Peter implicitly acknowledges this connection, as his next story is a variant of ML5080, \"Food from the Fairies\" (JPP 4.04). \n\n     The mound dwellers' baking is a model for low-level out group barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). The expectation of both parties is reasonable payment for services. In this story, the passing farmer enters into a contractual relationship with the mound dwellers, a relationship that he recognizes himself. The farmer, however, does not keep up his part of the bargain. One would expect that such a non-reciprocal transaction--effectively theft--would result in some form of retribution (or at least an attempt at retribution as in the case of the stolen drinking horn ML6045, \"Drinking Cup Stolen from the Fairies\"; JPP 4.04). Such is not the case here, and the man and his successors on the farm all get use of a remarkably well-forged tool, clearly of significant benefit to the farm's economy. The \"lang-j\u00e6rn\" [lit. long-iron] is known in English as a \"jointer knife\" and is a vertical blade that runs in front of the plowshare, and is used to help cut field stubble.\n\n     While it may be tempting to read the long iron as a gift from the mound dwellers (Boberg 1938; Mauss 1967), one would then have to disregard the statement, \"they didn't get any payment for it,\" a recognition that the encounter included an implicit, reciprocal, monetized transaction.\n\n     Tang Kristensen identified the supernatural beings in this story as dwarves, probably based on the Nordic mythological record that ascribes great prowess in smithing to dwarves. Jens Peter, however, makes no mention of dwarves, and it is more likely that the beings are the tradition dominant mound dwellers. This assignation would also link it to the next story about the mound dwellers' baking (JPP 4.04).\n\n     As typical for his stories, Jens Peter includes remarkable local detail about where the events transpired. L\u00f8rslev is just north of Ilbjerge huse, and Dals mill is just to the east. The other place names are the names of farms and houses in the immediate area.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Mand h. boede i et Sted, der kaldes\nMikkelsted eller Mikkelsgaard, h vilde til Dals\n\n7804A\nM\u00f8lle og kj\u00f8rer igiennem nogle Sandklitter eller\nGravaaler lige t\u00e6t norden og \u00f8sten for Huset\nder kaldes Sandkilde og der h\u00f8rer h. det sme-\nder derinde i en [V] lille H\u00f8j eller Banke\nsom Vejen gik igiennem, den gik ikke lang, som \nden gaar nu.
