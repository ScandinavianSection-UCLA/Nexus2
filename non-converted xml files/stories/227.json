The other farmhand is twice threatened: his work as a shepherd is disrupted and he is forced to work as a plowman for the other world. The act of plowing can also be read in the context of fertility and, accordingly, the ghost can be seen as a threat to the fertility of the community as well. \n\n     Neither farmhand develops a strategy for dealing with the revenant, other than running away. It is fortuitous that the farmhand escapes with only a fright. The refusal to mention the revenant in the church is puzzling, as one would imagine that the church would provide a degree of protection against this supernatural intrusion.\n\n     Tang Kristensen added the line \"it's him that I'm named after\" at the beginning of the published version of the story.
