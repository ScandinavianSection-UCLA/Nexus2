One day, he asked his driver to hitch up the wagon, and he climbed up and asked him to drive over to Boller manor farm. When he got into the farm he was supposed to drive a figure eight around the large linden trees according to old custom, and thus turn the horses around and then drive back the way that he had come, without paying attention to anything. But imagine their surprise at Boller when, just as they stood there with happy faces ready to greet the minister, the driver turned the horses around and drove off as fast as the horses could go; the minister had asked the driver to let the horses run since they were in a hurry. As soon as they had gotten home, the minister went in and lay down on his bed and was dead. He just wanted to say goodbye to his friends in Boller that way, since it was his last day alive.
