In some stories, the woman does the service to escape punishment for witchcraft (JPP 4.16). The prohibition on calling the wolves by their true name connects the wolves to Satan and other supernatural beings. The common expression, \"speak of the devil\" continues with, \"and he's in the room\"--given that the devil often kills people in the same room as him, it would be unwise to name him by name (BJK 1.15). This belief also accounts for the various nicknames given the devil, most prominent among them, Old Erik (BJK 1.23).\n\n     Jens adds a coda to the story, remarking that he is unsure of whether the wolves drowned or went to Sweden. This coda is amusing in light of the previous story of conjuring the mice onto one's enemies, and the bad blood between Denmark and Sweden in the aftermath of the wars of 1814 and 1867. Tang Kristensen deleted Jens's evaluative comment, \"Wasn't that strange,\" from the published version. Given the performance context, this evaluative meta-comment adds a certain humor to the story.", "danish_manuscript": "Karen Indjarsdatter (Ingvarsdatter) en gl. en hun\nskaffede alle Ulvene bort herfra Landet, h. var\nher fra Byen s. vidt a ved, ja var det ikke m\u00e6rkeligt\nDer kom en imod hende i Alleen her nede ved\n\n3250B\nTorstedlund, og da kom hu ridende paa dem og havde\ndem koblet sammen, paa den forreste.
