Karlen skulde flytte skjellet seks alen, det var jo en ager, og naboen kaldte de Mads S\u00f6rensen. Han flyttede s\u00e5 der fra Knud om November og flyttede til Horsens, og om sommeren efter fik han tyfus og d\u00f8de deraf.

Knud m\u00e5tte nu op til pr\u00e6sten og have ham derned. Degnen kaldte de Grejs Gr\u00e5, og han var kusk for pr\u00e6sten der til Skindbj\u00e6rg.

The farmhand was supposed to move the marker twelve feet, that was an acre, and the neighbor was called Mads S\u00f8rensen. The farmhand moved there from Knud in November and moved to Horsens, and the next summer he got typhus and died. Then when he was buried he sought his way back to Knud\u2019s place. When Knud came out at night, the farmhand stood right there, chalk white, outside the door. Knud knew what it meant and he closed the door again. But after that, every time he watered the jades in the evening, they saw that he came up again, just as chalk white, and the people were scared of him. Knud had to go up to the minister now and get him down there. They called the parish clerk Grejs Gr\u00e5 and he was the driver for the minister from Skindbj\u00e6rg. When they had been down there a little bit, the ghost appears. This here Mads S\u00f8rensen had been told to come along with a chevron, since he was supposed to be there to move the marker back again. Then when the revenant had come, the parish clerk says to the minister, that he should go out to him. Well, he really didn\u2019t want to. Then he\u2019ll do it, says the parish clerk, and then he went out to him. Then after they\u2019d talked together, the parish clerk says to Mads S\u00f8rensen and Knud that they could come now. The parish clerk follows the dead farmhand now to the place where he had dug the hole and then to where he had moved the marker from. They continued that way until they had done the entire dividing line. Then the ghost says when they get to the end of the line: \u201cIf you will forgive me, God will forgive you.\u201d Mads said yes, and then immediately the other one disappeared. Then when they were going to go home, the minister says to the parish clerk: Now he could get up in his seat, because he was his master. The minister used to say \u201cdu\u201d (a less formal form of the second person pronoun) to him, now he said \u201cI\u201d (a more formal form of the second person pronoun).", "keywords": {"keyword": ["burial", "chalk", "death", "digging", "disappearance", "door", "driver", "evening", "farmhand", "field", "ghost", "god", "home", "jade", "Knud", "Mads", "Mads S\u00f8rensen", "master", "minister", "neighbor", "night", "November", "outside", "parish clerk", "revenant", "summer", "white"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Gjenf\u00e6rd p\u00e5 uretf\u00e6rdig jord", "heading_english": "Revenants on ill-gotten land"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
