In many stories, the kidnapped girl never returns (DS I 860, 869). In contrast to those variants and his earlier story of a \"dance\" with the devil (troldt\u00f8j) where the girl dies (see 2.11 above), here the girl survives (see also DS I 832). \n\n     The man's quick intervention averts the likely calamity of the loss of the girl. The use of religious symbols--both iconographic such as the inscription of the cross in the landscape and the oral, such as prayer--have a great deal of power over these threats to the human community. \n\n     The young girl is an interesting victim for a number of reasons. First, given her youth and gender, she represents both childhood innocence, and the future of the community. A threat to her is a threat to the community's children now and, because she will presumably become a mother later, future generations of children. Second, because she is working as a shepherd, she is contributing in an integral way to the economy of the farm. A threat to her is a threat to the farm's productivity.", "danish_manuscript": "S. var der en Pige i T\u00f8rring hun var en 10 Aar\nog laa og vogtede Faarene ude i Marken tid-\nlig paa Foraaret og lige i Mundingen af et\nDal, og  der kj\u00f8rte en M. oven for og plove-\nde og s. albedst som h. s. kom til at se\nsig om, da havde Troldt\u00f8jet taget Pigen og\nkj\u00f8rte runden om med hende i Dalet op-\npe i Luften.
