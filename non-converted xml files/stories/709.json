I offered to follow him out there and around with a lantern, he was supposed to put something under the threshold of each stall where there were animals; but he didn't want me along, he went out alone. When he was done, I was to drive him to Fr\u00f8rup; I didn't want to since it was so dark. I told him that he could stay until the next day. He answered no. \"If I am not out of the farm by twelve o'clock, things will go wrong.\" I had to leave with him; but after that time, our calves did well. He had forgotten a place though, and that was the sheep house, and so now it affected the lambs, until we moved that house, and then everything was OK.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["animals", "calf", "clock", "Cunning Folk", "dark", "day", "death", "evening", "farm", "house", "lamb", "lantern", "misfortune", "morning", "rain", "sheep", "stall", "threshold"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Hekse og deres idr\u00e6tter", "heading_english": "Witches and their sport"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
