In the first story, Kr\u00e6n Degn does not join the joking, because he believes that Anders B\u00f8dker has cursed his fields, leading to considerable financial hardship. Given Anders's response to Poul's request, it seems that Jens is unsure whether to believe the alleged curse or not. The story, in that sense, mimics a similar negotiation that informs the townspeople's interaction with Anders as well. Although Kr\u00e6n is clearly convinced of Anders's maliciousness (and thus implicitly aligning him with witchcraft), the others seem less convinced.\n\n    The cursed cattle and fields carry over to the curse on technology in the next story. By the second half of the nineteenth century, new types of plows, particularly the swing plow, were replacing the earlier wheeled plows. These plows required fewer draught animals to pull them, yet they also required farmers' to develop new skills to use them effectively.  Pulling out of the furrows, or plowing too deep would, of course, lead to unsatisfactory results. The cunning man appears to be part technician in this story, making adjustments to the poorly functioning plow. While witches are generally blamed for cursing plows, the mare and the Wandering Jew are also known to curse them. \n\n    Neither Anders B\u00f8dker, Iver Ott nor Old Villads are mentioned in H. P. Hansen's two volume work on cunning folk (1943) or R\u00f8rbye's later overview of cunning folk in Denmark (R\u00f8rbye 1976). The scope of practice of these cunning men is similar to that of many other rural folk healers--here, the focus is on guaranteeing success in agricultural endeavors. Knowledge of cunning, including ownership of books such as the Cyprianus, was frequently passed down in families.\n\n     An average spinning wheel would be approximately sixty centimeters in diameter.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en i Gravlev de kaldte Anders B\u00f8dker\nh. forheksede Kr\u00e6n Degns Mark paa Fl\u00f8\u00f8 der\nblev et Sted s. stort omkring som et Rokke-\nhjul.
