Given the prevalence of mound folk in Margrete's repertoire, it is quite likely that she has conflated the two categories of supernatural beings. The description of the elves presented here is more in line with other descriptions of mound dwellers. In other legends, elves are presented as individualistic, seductive female figures, whose backs appear as hollowed out or rotten tree trunks (DS II A 50; DS II A 59). Elves do not generally appear as collective beings as they do here, a characteristic of the mound folk. Both Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter and Peder Johansen engage in a similar conflation of the categories of elves and mound dwellers (KMP 1.60; PJ 2.03).\n\n     In this story, the elves disrupt the economic productivity of the farm by interfering with the boy's ability to look after the cattle (PJ 2.11). It is only through the quick intervention of the farmhand who, coincidentally, is also engaged in normal farm-based economic activity, that the boy is saved. The encounter with the elves marks the boy for the rest of his life, and underscores the continuing and potentially long-lasting danger that these supernatural beings pose. \n\n     The relationship Margrete draws between elves and alder wood builds on a common false etymology. The word Danish word for elves, elvefolk, is often pronounced ellefolk. The presumed root would link it to elletr\u00e6 (alder wood). The root of elvefolk actually derives from the old common Nordic root, \u00e1lfr. As a result of the false etymology, elves are often linked to stands of alder wood in legend.", "danish_manuscript": "Ved en H\u00f8j inde ved Skj\u00f8dstrup var der\ns. mange ellefolk.
