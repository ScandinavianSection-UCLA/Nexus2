De havde taget levnetsmidler med for 6 m\u00e5neder. Men hver ottende dag gik de udenfor huset og hejsede et stykke frisk kj\u00f6d op p\u00e5 en lang stang. Det h\u00e6ngte der, til de kom n\u00e6ste gang, og blev s\u00e5 nedtaget. I lange tider var det helt ford\u00e6rvet og sort, n\u00e5r det kom ned, og det var tegn p\u00e5, at pesten endnu var i luften.

S\u00e5dan vandrede de fra by til by i hele sognet. Folk l\u00e5 d\u00f8de p\u00e5 marken ved plove og led, og intet andet levende var der end \u00f6rne og rovdyr.

They had brought food and water along for six months. But every eight days they went outside the house and raised a piece of fresh meat up on a long pole. It hung there until they came again and then it was taken down. For a long time, it was completely rotten and black when it came down, and that was a sign that the plague was still in the air. It continued like that until the meat was fresh when they took it down again because then there was no longer any danger. Then they said to one another: \"Now we\u2019ll go and see to our neighbors.\" At that time there were twelve farms just like now. But they went from house to house and found only dead people and animals. They wandered from village to village like this in the whole parish. People lay dead in the fields by plows and gates, and there was nothing else alive except for eagles and beasts of prey. Houses stood empty for twenty-five to thirty years after that. A minister was brought out from \u00c5benr\u00e5 to the church, and he said a prayer of thanksgiving for the end of the plague.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["air", "animals", "beast", "black", "church", "danger", "day", "death", "door", "farm", "field", "food", "gate", "house", "meat", "minister", "month", "neighbor", "Nis Madsen", "outside", "parish", "plague", "plowing", "pole", "prayer", "rotten", "thank", "three", "village", "walls", "wandering", "water", "young"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Pest og sygdomme", "heading_english": "Plague and illnesses"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
