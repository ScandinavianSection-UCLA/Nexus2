Birthing was a dangerous proposition, and the incidence of death in childbirth was high. There are multiple explanations for the nisse's request for help. It is likely that the nisse hopes that the child can become Christian through the intervention of the human midwife, and the subsequent payment that results in the gift to Dover church. It is equally possible that the nisse's wife is a human, kidnapped into the other world. Accordingly, the wife would need a human to help her deliver.\n\n     Peder's story of midwife to the nisse is unusual in that he casts the nisse in the role of supernatural protagonist rather than a mound dweller. Nisser are generally solitary figures and there are few stories in which they have families. John Lindow's analysis of the nisse would preclude a nisse family (Lindow 1975), since his analysis show nisse to be decidedly male and non-fertile.\n\n    The reward offered the woman for her services and her reaction are typical. Things from the other world--food, money, animals--are often not what they appear to be. Here, of course, they are much more valuable than they seem. The stories can be seen as addressing the complexities of low level out group transactions, where the value of goods and services exchanged is hard to calculate (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n    Many variants of this story resolve negatively when the woman discovers that she has thrown away considerable wealth since the one or two shavings remaining in her apron have transformed into gold (DS I 1137). Peder's secondary ending allows for a more positive resolution.\n\n     Peder also adds a short, secondary story, also widely attested, and also usually related to the mound dwellers. Peder's tale emphasizes the symbiotic nature of the relationship between the farmer and the nisse.", "danish_manuscript": "I Svejstrup \u00d8stergaard havde Gaardbonisser-\nne slaaet Bolig under deres N\u00f8ds.
