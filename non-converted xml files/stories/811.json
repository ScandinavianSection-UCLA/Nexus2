The hired boy who took care of the cows also had to take care of the troll\u2019s cow but he also got paid for that because every day near the mound there would be a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top. Then one year the farmer hired a boy who was really nasty. The first day he went out with the cows, the troll\u2019s black cow also came along. The boy now went over to the mound to see if it was true what he\u2019d heard that there was supposed to be a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top there. Well, sure enough, it was true and the boy ate the pancakes and put the two shilling piece in his pocket. But then he unbuttoned his pants and did what he had to on the plate. From that day on, neither pancakes nor the two shilling piece appeared, but the black cow continued to appear, so the boy had to take care of the troll\u2019s cow without any pay.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["black", "boy", "cow", "day", "farmer", "field", "grazing", "horn", "mound", "pancake", "pants", "plate", "pocket", "shilling", "troll", "year"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Bj\u00e6rgfolk", "heading_english": "Mound dwellers (Hidden folk)"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
