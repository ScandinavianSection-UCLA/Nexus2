A robber who was called Daniel was supposed to have lived in it.

The farmhands let themselves be bound first and they tried to get up, and they were tied up and let go like that, one after the other. Finally, Daniel was tied up, but then they wouldn't let him go again. He asked them to untie him until he finished swallowing what he had in his pocket. It was a child's heart. He'd already swallowed two and he believed that if he could eat three unborn boy baby's hearts, then no one would be able to defeat him. But they wouldn't untie him. He was executed and, according to what they say, buried in the cemetery where his grave is in the southeast corner.
