Den samme gamle mand gik hen og h\u00e6ngte sig, og siden sagde de, at han sp\u00f6gte p\u00e5 g\u00e5rden og gik, ligesom han gik i levende live. Min gamlefader kom s\u00e5 til at forpagte den g\u00e5rd. Der var s\u00e5dan en voldsom stor dagligstue, og henne i bagsiden var to senge, der var panelet inde, men i forsiden var forstued\u00f6ren og kj\u00f8kkend\u00f6ren lige for hinanden. Min moder og s\u00e5 deres tjenestepige l\u00e5 i den ene seng.

Hun s\u00e5 ikke, d\u00f6ren gik op, men han skred lige s\u00e5 stille over stuegulvet og keg sig runden omkring. Hun tykte tydelig, hun kunde h\u00f8re, det sukkede, og endelig skred det ud af kj\u00f8kkend\u00f6ren, og s\u00e5 m\u00e6rkede hun ikke til videre.

That same old man went and hanged himself and, ever since, they said that he haunted at the farm and went about at the farm just as he had when he was alive. My grandfather got a lease on that farm. There was a really big living room, and in the back there were two beds which were paneled in but, in the front, there was the door to the front room and the kitchen door right beside each other. My mother and their serving girl lay in one of the beds. One night about midnight, my mother was lying awake and the moon was shining in so she could see everything, then all of a sudden a shape came in through the door. She clearly recognized that it was the old man, she had seen him many times and it seemed like he walked in and stood there. She didn\u2019t see the door open, but he went so quietly over the floor and looked around. She thought she could clearly hear that he sighed. Finally it went out the kitchen door. They could never keep their barn door closed at night and they could hear it banging regardless how often they closed it.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["banging", "barn", "bed", "door", "farm", "floor", "girl", "grandfather", "hat", "haunting", "kitchen", "lease", "leather", "midnight", "moon", "mother", "night", "old", "pants", "sweater"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Forskjelligt sp\u00f8geri og gjenf\u00e6rds nedmaning", "heading_english": "Revenants and their conjuring"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
