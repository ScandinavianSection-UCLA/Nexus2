It is interesting to note that an itinerant peddler, known by the nickname \"Ridesvends kr\u00e6mmer,\" figures in this tale, given the numerous stories that Kirsten Marie tells about these untrustworthy wanderers. \n\n     The word \"gilde\" (feast) only makes sense in this story if it is taken to mean wedding celebration. Presumably the peddler has a daughter, and the boy is married to her. When the peddler commits suicide, the boy, now his son-in-law, inherits from him. According to Danish inheritance law, the son-in-law would, by marriage, be entitled to the inheritance from his wife's father, as long as they remained married.\n\n     The story was never published in any of Tang Kristensen's collections.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var i den Tid Vorherre og Sant Peder\nde gik paa Jorden, s. kom de ind og bad Hus\net Sted og vilde ligge.

Then the Ridesvends peddler in the other bed thought that that would be quite a lie, was going to make sure that it wouldn't happen. Went off. When the child got bigger, he got hold of him and he was to be with him. He was a peddler and he followed along with him. One day he wrote a letter and sent him home with it and they should kill him. Along the way, he came past a cemetery, lay down there and slept and put the letter under his head. Then they came out of the church, and the minister went over and saw what was written in the letter.

De fik ogsaa Lov til at ligge der, men kort i Forvejen var Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer ogsaa kommen dertil og havde forlangt Nattely, og ham havde de ogsaa huset. Han var nu allerede gaaet ti Ro, og saa kom Vorherre og Sant-Peder ogsaa til Ro, men de laa da hver i sin Seng. Lidt efter h\u00f8rte de, te Konen i Huset hun kom i Barnsn\u00f8d. Saa siger Vorherre og til Sant-Peder: \u201dGaa ud og se, hvad Stj\u00e6rner der er paa Himmelen.\u201d Han gik og kom ind igjen og fortalte det. \u201dJa, saa kan det ikke gaa an at lade Barnet blive f\u00f8dt endnu, for hvis det nu blev f\u00f8dt, saa skulde det h\u00e6nges.\u201d Konen hun laa nu og klagede sig der inde, og saa et Stykke Tid efter siger Vorherre igjen til Sant-Peder, at han skal gaa ud og se efter, hvad Stj\u00e6rner der er nu paa Himmelen. Han kommer tilbage og fort\u00e6ller det. \u201dNej, saa kan det ikke gaa an endnu, for hvis Barnet nu blev f\u00f8dt, saa skuld det br\u00e6ndes.\u201d Der gaar igjen en Tid og Konen ligger og klager sig jammerlig. \u201dNu kan du gaa ud og se igjen.\u201d Han gaar og kommer tilbage og fort\u00e6ller, hvad han har set. \u201dJa, nu kan det gaa,\u201d siger Vorherre, \u201dfor naar det nu bliver f\u00f8dt, saa skal den komme til at arve Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer.\u201d Saa maatte Drengen altsaa blive f\u00f8dt, og han blev det ogsaa. Nu laa Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer jo i den anden Seng, og han laa og h\u00f8rte det. Saa t\u00e6nkte han: \u201dDet skal blive en farlig L\u00f8gn, det skal a nok se at faa forb\u00f8jen.\u201d Om Morgenen rejste han derfra igjen, og Vorherre og Sant-Peder gjorde ogsaa. Barnet vokste godt til og blev en dygtig Dreng. Nu havde Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer jo hans Opm\u00e6rksomhed henvendt paa den Dreng, og saa kommer han en Gang tilbage dertil og forlanger at faa den Dreng. Han foregav, han skulde f\u00f8lge med ham ud at handle og da faa det saa og saa godt. Han fortalte jo, han var Kr\u00e6mmer, og For\u00e6ldrene tykte godt om hans Forslag og lod ham faa Drengen. Der gik nogle Dage hen, og Drengen havde det godt nok. Men saa skriver Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer en Dag et Brev, og det skulde han gaa hjem til hans Kone og Datter med, og han gav ham jo Besked om Vejen. I det Brev stod der, at naar Overbringeren af det Brev kom, saa skulde de slaa ham ihjel, og det skulde gj\u00f8res saa betids, at han kunde v\u00e6re henne, inden Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer kom hjem. Han gaar saa med Brevet, det gj\u00f8r Drengen, men det var en lang Vej, og han blev tr\u00e6t. Saa kom han forbi en Kirkegaard, og der kom han i Tanker om at gaa ind og l\u00e6gge sig lidt for at hvile, og han lagde Brevet under hans Hoved. Men nu var han jo saa tr\u00e6t, og da han saadan ligger, falder han i S\u00f8vn. Nu var det netop en S\u00f8ndag, og der var Tjeneste i Kirken. Den Gang Folkene kom ud, var der nogle, der saa den Dreng, og de gaar hen og fort\u00e6ller Pr\u00e6sten det. Han kommer saa hen til ham og ser paa ham, og saa faar han ogsaa det Brev at se, der ligger under hans Hoved. Han lister sig til at faa fat i det og br\u00e6kker det og l\u00e6ser, hvad der staar. Da f\u00f8ler han jo Medynk med den kj\u00f8nne Dreng og gaar ind og skriver Brevet om, saa der kommer til at staa, at de skulde give Overbringeren af Brevet Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmers Datter snarest mulig, og de skulde str\u00e6be saadan med at have Gilde, at det hele kunde v\u00e6re til Side, inden han selv kommer hjem. Han stak nu saa lettelig Brevet ind under Drengens Hoved igjen, og saa gik de hver til sit. Naa, Drengen vaagnede omsider, og saa kom han afsted igjen, og kom endelig hjem til Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmers Hus og gav hans Kone Brevet. Hun l\u00e6ste, hvad der stod, og fik nu travlt med at faa det ordnet. Men de fik da Gilde og alting var klappet og klart, da Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer kom hjem. Han blev jo saa flyvegal, da han h\u00f8rte, hvad der var gaaet for sig. Men Konen viste ham jo Brevet, og saa kunde han jo selv se, hvad han havde skrevet saa hun havde ingen Skyld i det. Han blev nu saa \u00e6rgerlig, at han gik hen og tog sig selv af med Livet, og saa arvede Drengen jo det hele, der var ingen n\u00e6rere til det, og saadan gik det i Opfyldelse, hvad Vorherre havde sagt.\n\nNavnet blev indtalt: Riisvends Kr\u00e6mer.

They were given permission to stay there, but a short time earlier the Ridesvends Kr\u00e6mmer (The Outrider\u00b4s Peddler) had also arrived there and had asked for lodgings, and they had also given him quarter. He had already gone to bed, and then Our Lord and Saint Peter also went to bed, but they lay each in their own bed. A little later they heard that the woman of the house had gone into labor. Then Our Lord says to Saint Peter: \u201cGo out and see which stars are in the heavens.\u201d He went out and came back in again and told him. \u201cWell, then we can\u2019t let the child be born yet, because if it is born now, then it will be hung.\u201d So the woman lies complaining in there some more, and then a little bit later, Our Lord once again tells Saint Peter to go out and see which stars are in the heavens. He comes back and tells him. \u201cNo, it still isn\u2019t right, because if the child was born now, then it would be burned.\u201d A little time goes by again, and the woman is still lying in there complaining horribly. \u201cNow you can go out and look again.\u201d He comes back and tells him what he has seen. \u201cYes, now it is OK,\u201d says Our Lord, \u201cbecause when the child is born now, then he will inherit from the Outrider\u2019s Peddler. Then the boy could be born, and he was. Now the Outrider\u2019s Peddler lay in the other bed, and he lay there and listened to this. Then he thought to himself: \u201cThat will be one heck of a lie, I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d The next morning, he left again, and Our Lord and Saint Peter did too. The child grew up well and became a clever lad. Now the Outrider\u2019s Peddler had focused his attention on the boy, and so one time he comes back to that place and asks to have the boy. He told them that he was a peddler, and the parents liked his proposal and they let him have the boy. A couple of days passed, and the boy was doing fine. But then one day the Outrider\u2019s Peddler writes a letter, and the boy was to take it home to the peddler's wife and daughter, and he told him how to get there. It was written in the letter that when the bearer of the letter arrived they were to kill him, and it should be done so quickly that he would be dead before the Outrider\u2019s Peddler came home. So he walks off with the letter, the boy does, but it was a long way, and he gets tired. So he walks past a cemetery, and he decided to go in and lie down a bit to take a rest, and he put the letter under his head. But he was so tired that when he lay down like that, he fell asleep. Now it turned out that it was a Sunday, and there were services in the church. When the people came out, there were some who saw the boy, and they go off and tell the minister that. He comes over to him, and then he also notices the letter which is under his head. Stealthily, he gets a hold of it and opens it and reads what it says. Now he feels a great deal of sympathy for the beautiful boy and goes inside and rewrites the letter so that it says that they should give the bearer of the letter the Outrider Peddler\u2019s daughter as his bride as soon as possible, and exert themselves to have a wedding banquet so that it can all be done by the time he comes home. He now carefully put the letter back under the boy\u2019s head again, and then they all left. Well, the boy woke up after a while, and then he set off again, and finally he gets to the Outrider Peddler\u2019s house and gave the peddler\u2019s wife the letter. She read what it said, and now got busy arranging everything. They had the wedding banquet and had everything done free and clear by the time the Outrider\u2019s Peddler came home. He became so crazed with anger when he heard what had happened. But his wife showed him the letter, and he could see for himself what he had written, she had no fault in this. He became so aggravated that he went and killed himself, and then the boy inherited all of it, there were no closer relatives, and that\u2019s how what Our Lord had said was fulfilled.\n\nThe name was recorded as: Riisvends Kr\u00e6mer.
