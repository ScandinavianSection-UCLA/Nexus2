Mikkel is at first unwilling to listen to the complaint, and insists that he is the owner of the mound. His decision to help the mound dweller is akin to the farmer's decision to repair the peel board in stories of the mound dweller's baking (JPP 4.04). In this case, the mound dweller acknowledges the contractual arrangement and pays rent to Mikkel for the use of the mound. Mikkel's goodwill in repairing the mound and accepting the mound dweller's rent payment is also repaid.

One day he started driving peat from a mound he had on his field back home to his dung heap.

No, he answers, he hadn't done that, he hadn't taken the roof off of anyone's house. Yes, he'd taken peat from the hill. Well, he says, he wouldn't bring the peat back, since he paid taxes and rent for the mound just as for his other property. Well, he could tell them how much tax he paid for that land, they'd pay him back. He didn't know. Well, he'd better thatch their house again, otherwise it would go bad for him. The next morning he started driving some of it back to the mound again, and he leveled it and brought it back into shape. After that, every morning when he got up, there was a little hole in the window, just big enough for a four shilling piece to fit through, and every morning there was a four shilling piece in the window. That was to cover his expenses with the mound. About three or four days later, he was taking his afternoon nap, and someone comes to the window and shouts, \"Meggel, Meggel, your foal that is standing a bit to the north here has gotten tangled in its harness, and it is dying.\" He jumped up and got the horse out of the harness and saved it, and it got better even though it was really in bad shape. A little later he yet another foal which had gotten tangled in the reins and it had fallen down into a ditch and was lying on its back and was just about dead.
