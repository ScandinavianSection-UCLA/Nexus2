The amusing double theft described in this legend points to the zero sum game that characterizes Foster's description of early peasant societies conceptions of \"limited good\":  one person's gain is another person's loss (Foster 1965).\n\n     Having a farmhand accompany the nisse on his raid of the nearby farm is a slightly unusual feature of this story. The farmhand's precarious perch in the tree during the fight is reminiscent of the farmhand who tries to witness the conjuring of the devil (KMP 1.07).\n\n     The farmhand's presence also allows Kirsten Marie to tell the fairly common story of how the nisse learns to rest (DS II B 48). The nisse, despite his diminutive size, is able to carry an enormous load. As with many supernatural beings and phenomena, what is immediately visible is often misleading. The nisse's outburst about rest underscores his nonhuman status.", "danish_manuscript": "Dem i Hallendrup de havde 1 Nisse og dem\ni Ginderup havde 1.
