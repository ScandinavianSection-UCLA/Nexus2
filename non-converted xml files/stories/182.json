Many stories attest to the contractual arrangement between a nisse and his farmer, in which the farmer provides the nisse with one humble meal a year (porridge and butter), and possibly a new set of clothes (DS II B 146). In return, the nisse guarantees if not the wealth then at least the success of the farm in the coming year. The contract stands as an extreme version of the standard contract between farmhands and farmers. In this context, it is worth noting that the term \"nis\" is a diminutive for the name \"Niels,\" a common name for farmhands. The story also reflects the ambiguity related to negotiating contracts or engaging in transactions with members of an outside group.\n\n     In this story, the nisse believes the farmer has underpaid him for his work. Other stories consider what happens when the farmer overpays, usually by giving the nisse clothes that are too nice for his social status (farmhand) (DS II B 214).\n\n     The story of a nisse who kills the cow after not finding butter in his porridge is very common (DS II B 185). In some variants, the new cow tries to get back to its old farm or is otherwise confused about its new surroundings (DS II B 211). In some cases, the new cow is better than the one it replaced (DS II B 188). The stolen cow always comes from a neighboring parish, or even further afield. Theft outside of the community is apparently less problematic, perhaps because it does not impact the immediate economy. Crossing parish lines guarantees that the theft affects outsiders.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Gaardbo paa Stempegaard i\nB\u00f8rglum Sogn -- det er den ene af de to\nGaarde af det Navn og h. havde en r\u00f8d\nKo at passe og den skaff. h.
