Racing the revenant is also widely attested (DS V 715), and the similarity between these stories confirms the Lutheran conflation of revenants with Satan (Tangherlini 1998).\n\n     Master Niels, a wise minister, figures prominently in one of Jens Peter's other stories (JPP 1.08). He proves himself once again to be adept at protecting the community against the threat of the revenant (in the earlier story, he also fought with a guilty haunt). It is unclear why the man at H\u00e6strup mill haunts, although it seems likely he is a guilty haunt, given that the two race to \"the scene of the crime.\" Peder Johansen also tells several stories that indicate that mill workers were not necessarily the most honest people (PJ 1.02).  \n\n     While it is possible that this story and JPP 1.08 are the same story, \u00c5strup mill is approximately five and half kilometers north and west of H\u00e6strup mill. Given Jens Peter's precision concerning topography and place names, it seems unlikely that he would confuse the two places. It is more likely that Jens Peter considered mills to be sites of corruption and dishonesty, which led in turn to haunting (and stories about hauntings).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en der boede i H\u00e6strup gamle\nM\u00f8lle, h. var s. slem til at gaa igien.\nS var Mester Nielsen fra Hj\u00f8rring der\nude at mane ham.
