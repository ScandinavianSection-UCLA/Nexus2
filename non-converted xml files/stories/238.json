It is related to stories of the mound dwellers baking and people being kidnapped by the mound dwellers (DS I 381, 382, 832). The dance of the mound dwellers stands as a supernatural temptation, as does the seemingly seductive offer of the drink. \n\n     The farmhand is out at night--a liminal time--and far from the protection of the \"inside\" of the farm. He recognizes the threat, however, and throws the drink over his shoulder. While he escapes unscathed, the horse is injured, a recognition of just how close he has come to a bad end. His smart thinking of riding across the plowed fields, and thus inscribing a cross on the ground making it impossible for the non-Christian mound woman to pursue him, would otherwise be considered transgressive (PJ 2.03). In many stories, one finds that the best strategy for dealing with outside threat is to do something that would otherwise be considered anti-social, such as riding across freshly plowed fields. \n\n      The use of the drinking horn to support the building of a church or the use of the vessel as a chalice is a common resolution to these stories (DS I 807, 813). In those variants where the person keeps the horn for their own personal gain, the mound dwellers often return to reclaim it (DS I 796). The use of the wealth of the mound dwellers to support the community, on the other hand, is narratively lauded.\n\n     The story ends with a series of etiological tags that explain the names of local places. The etiology of the mound name, \"Turning Mound,\" is more elaborate in the published version than in the original version.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en G. en Karl h. red [d] forbi en\nH\u00f8j, H\u00e6ningsh\u00f8j, den ligger s\u00f8nden for Horn-\nslet.
