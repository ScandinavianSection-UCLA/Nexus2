Foremost among these complaints was that employers did not allow them to attend family celebrations. The girl's suicide is an extreme example of the anguish caused by restrictive employment contracts.\n\n    Committing suicide was deeply taboo, and the bodies of suicides were not buried in the church cemetery. At the same time, suicides often came back as haunts. The villagers in this story engage a strategy aimed at preventing the girl from haunting to little avail, since the girl returns as the night raven, mentioned in the previous story.\n\n     Using oxen to pull the cart with the girl's body to find her burial place is reminiscent of the oxen that are used to pull building materials to the site of a church (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck 1958). That the oxen in this case bring her to the churchyard indicates her virtue, an interpretation confirmed in the story by the minister's evaluative comment. The girl is finally buried in a liminal place, literally between Heaven and Hell (Heaven and Hell as place names for farms occur in other stories as well, cf. PJ 1.02).\n\n      \"Stor t\u00f8s\" has been translated as \"little girl\" to avoid awkward translations such as \"big lass.\"", "danish_manuscript": "Det var \nsaadan en stor T\u00f8s der skulde v\u00e6re Hyrde, den\nDag hendes S\u00f8ster havde Bryllup.
