The reference to the rune stone found in the newly apportioned field at once emphasizes the responsibility of the individual, rather than the collective (jordf\u00e6llesskab), to care for the fields. At the same time, the discovery of the rune stone alludes to the long history of the earlier organization of the fields. The rune stone is plowed back into the field, and the historical connection between the past and the future is lost--one can no longer find the connection to the past in the current organization of the fields.\n\n     The stone described here must be absolutely massive, since four horses cannot pull it. Such a massive size is out of line with most rune stones that were of more modest proportions. The description of the runes is odd, since runes were carved into the stone, and would appear as depressions. Runes would not look as if they had been glued on to the stone. \n\n     Rune stones were less of a common find in Danish fields than they were in Swedish fields (Moltke 1976 and 1985). In Sweden, many stones were blown up by farmers intent on clearing their fields of what they considered to be nuisances. Nevertheless, there are numerous documented instances of farmers discovering rune stones and other earlier archaeological treasures while plowing. Perhaps the best known rune stones in Denmark are the two stones in the churchyard at Jelling, known as the elder and younger Jelling stones, the smaller of which was used as a bench outside of the church until 1627.     \n\n     Runes and the inscription of runes have often been attributed magical power. Rune stones themselves often refer to these powers. This story, however, makes no mention of any such magical connection. The surmise that the rune stone had stood on top of the mound is possible, although not likely, as most rune stones were placed near roads. \n\n     There are significant differences between the published version and the manuscript version. Tang Kristensen changed the source of the story from Jens's maternal aunt to his mother, and moved several other references to the timing of the story to the front of the narrative. Jens mentioned the events in a later session with Tang Kristensen in a far less detailed story (BJK 4.24). In that short narrative, Jens mentioned that the motivation for digging up the stone was to use the large rock as building material, a surprisingly common fate for many such stones.", "danish_manuscript": "Der ligger en Runesten paa den tredje Ager s\u00f8n-\nden for Bavneh\u00f8j [s\u00f8nden for Bavneh\u00f8j] saa-\ndan sagde min Moster, hendes Fader pl\u00f8jede\nimod den og s. viste h. hans Karl ud at kaste\n\n3242B\nden ned, for den var s. forf\u00e6rdelig stor at 4\nHeste kunde ikke tr\u00e6kke den derfra.
