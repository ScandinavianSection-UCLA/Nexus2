Mos lake is Denmark's fourth largest lake with an area of seventeen square kilometers.\n\n     It is unclear who the Turk to whom he alludes might be, although the Turk is mentioned in numerous other apocryphal legends (DS II G 339). The Turk may be an allusion to stories of Holger Danske and his fight against a Turkish king. Turks were often represented as a frightening, distant yet threatening group. In some legends, there is an implication that the Turkish king would eventually overthrow the Danish crown (DS II G 351). In several legends, the Turks are replaced with Germans, a substitution that resonates with the clear threat of Bismark's Prussia from the 1860s up through the end of the nineteenth century (DS II G 340). The substitution of German for Turk is linguistically simple given the closeness in Danish between the words \"tyrkere\" (Turk) and \"tyskere\" (German).\n\n     Given immigration patterns in the past forty years to Denmark, there is a strong possibility that someone from Turkey has swum in the lake. At the same time, it seems somewhat unlikely that any modern Dane of Turkish heritage has cattle that need watering.
