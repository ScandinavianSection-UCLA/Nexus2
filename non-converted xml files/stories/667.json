A little while later, a mound man came to the midwife and asked her to come and help his wife as she'd promised. She followed the man and he brought her into a mound where she delivered his wife. When she was done and was going to leave, the mound man gave her a bag full of wood shavings. The midwife didn't really want them, but the mound man's wife asked her to take them, she'd be paid for her inconvenience, she said. The midwife took the bag, but when she got home and opened it, the wood shavings had turned into shiny silver coins.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["bags", "coins", "home", "message", "midwife", "mound", "mound man", "name", "silver", "toad", "wife", "wood"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Bj\u00e6rgfolk", "heading_english": "Mound dwellers (Hidden folk)"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
