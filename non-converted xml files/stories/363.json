Seeds gathered at calendrically liminal periods, such as Saint Hans, a summer solstice celebration, are considered to be magically powerful. Bracken seeds were generally considered to be associated with witchcraft (BJK 3.12). Bracken, or ferns, do not actually produce seeds, but rather produce spores. Another magical seed is linseed, used to prevent the passage of witches (DS V 1111 and DS IV 744). The written piece of paper to which Margrete alludes was a common feature in magical practice. The most complete magical writings are found in compendia of magic verses, incantations and directions known as Cyprianus. These books were mostly in the possession of cunning folk and not witches. \n\n      Margrete does not seem overly concerned about her failure to collect any seeds, and there is a hint that she did not believe that her companion was successful either.\n\n     The published version changes the order of the wording slightly, moving the identification of Margrete's companion to the beginning of the account.", "danish_manuscript": "Bregner skal ikke b\u00e6re Fr\u00f8 uden Skt Hans\nAften.
