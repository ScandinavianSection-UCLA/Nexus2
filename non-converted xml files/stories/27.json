Here, the elf hag, known as a seductress from other stories, approaches him, ostensibly to warm herself. The man assaults her--in this case, sexually--and she in turn calls for assistance.\n\n     The story is closely related to Jens Peter's story of the injured mermaid, who calls to the merman to protect her (JPP 2.20 and JPP 4.02). In both cases, the man guarding a solitary refinery burns the supernatural being. The being responds with an obscure exclamation, similar to the statement in the legend of Pan's death (JPP 4.12). Unlike Jens Peter's story, Bitte Jens includes the clever response of the collier that allows him enough time to escape from the trolls. The resulting destruction is similar in both stories. \n\n     Peat was commonly used as a heating fuel. Although it burned at a low temperature and created a lot of smoke, it was readily available. Charcoal, by contrast, burned cleanly at a high temperature, and for a long time. It was not commonly used to heat houses since wood was scarce; rather it was used for fires that needed to be hot such as those used for smithing. Charcoal was made in a pit, referred to as a pile, by directly burning the wood that was to become charcoal. Making charcoal in pits was difficult and the piles required a great deal of attention from the colliers. Oxygen entering the pit was regulated, so that the charcoal itself did not burn. An abandoned pile could burn out of control and quite possibly explode.", "danish_manuscript": "Saadan fortalte de ogsaa om en M. fra Rold, det var ogsaa dh. Bj\u00e6rgf.
