Although indications in the manuscript suggest that the two stories were told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, there are several factors that argue against this. First, and perhaps most importantly, the stories are extremely localized, and take place in Torsager, a town forty-six kilometers away from Kirsten Marie's residence in Hornslet. Torsager does not figure in any of Kirsten Marie's other stories. When Kirsten Marie mentions places, which she does often, those places tend to be either major market towns, such as \u00c5rhus or Randers, or in the immediate vicinity of Rud and Nielstrup. Second, the index to Danske sagn lists  this story as being told by Teacher N. S\u00f8rensen, Torsager, and the next story as being told by Jakob J\u00f6rgensen from Torsager. There is, however, no mention of Teacher S\u00f8rensen in Minder og Oplevelser. After Tang Kristensen left Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter on this, his penultimate visit to her, he took a train to Torsager (MO IV 5). It is likely that he met L\u00e6rer N. S\u00f8rensen on the train or at the train station, or perhaps at Provst Hansen's house, where he went soon after his arrival in Torsager (MO IV 5). \n\n     The index on the cover of the field diary volume is difficult to read, but it indicates that the stories following those told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter were told by Kristiane Mogensdatter (6424b-6427b) and Elisabeth Poulsen (6427b-6429b). The names and page numbers on these volume covers are a later addition by Else Ramsy of the Danish Folklore Archive and are known to be inaccurate at times.", "danish_manuscript": "Vig af\nKolundsund har forl\u00e6nget sig helt op til Tors\nager. det er en gl.
