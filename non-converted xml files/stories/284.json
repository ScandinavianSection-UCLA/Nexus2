This version of the story is more detailed than the first. The most significant change is the addition of the segment in which Rasmus consults with the local minister and is assured that he can consult the cunning man as long as he does it in the name of God. Rasmus's wife's response to his quiet return home is slightly different than the response in the first variant. Nevertheless, it serves the same release of narrative tension since Rasmus believes his wife has found \"peace\" in death, and not through a sudden and seemingly miraculous recovery. The earlier evaluative tag noting that Rasmus could not figure out how this had happened is missing from this variant.", "danish_manuscript": "Min Oldefaders Kone var saa syg a hends Laar\nog H\u00e6fte og skreg saadan.
