While there were a number of gypsies living in Denmark in the nineteenth century, the population was small. This story relies, as many of Kirsten Marie's stories do, on the clear distinction between rural social classes. The miller was an important community figure, often owned considerable land himself, and would be counted among the most important members of a parish (see discussion of millers in chapter on Peder Johansen). Inheriting a mill would have guaranteed the young woman a steady income and a comfortable existence as opposed to the harrowing experiences that awaited her as the wife of a vagabond. \n\n      The gypsy brings the marital discord--a representation of the hard life Gertrude has chosen for herself--right to Kirsten Marie's father's doorstep, while her great grandmother cries for the girl's tragic choice of poverty over security and relative wealth.", "danish_manuscript": "Der vester ude ved en M\u00f8lle der var en Tater-\nmand der var bliven Kj\u00e6reste med Datteren\n\n5219A\ni M\u00f8llen.
