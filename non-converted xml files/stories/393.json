A toxic blue green algae (as Peder describes) can form on lakes during hot, still weather. If cows ingest the algae with their drinking water, they can suffer massive liver damage, and die within the hour (Bovine Blue-Green Algae Toxicosis).\n\n     Animal epidemics and other sudden animal deaths were a devastating phenomenon in rural Jutland, and could ravage the economy of an entire community. These epidemics became a particular threat when farms moved away from a grains based agriculture to one emphasizing animal husbandry, dairy herds in particular.\n\n     Working at the mill, Peder was in a perfect position to hear from all of the farmers the problems that they were having on their farms, including problems with their herds.", "danish_manuscript": "[S. snar som] Den Sommer te F\u00e6sygen\n[da] var her, da var der saadan Varme og Tan\nning te alting d\u00f8de hen og alt gr\u00e6sset\nsvejtest og S\u00f8en (Mos S\u00f8) var overtrukken\nmed et gr\u00f8nt Lag formedelst der var saa-\ndan meget stille Vejr.
