In both cases, something supernatural appears at a liminal point in the calendar. Of course, finding new hay at New Years is more difficult than making porridge at Christmas. The haunt in this story appears as a black dog, a common form for haunts in Jens Peter's repertoire (JPP 1.05, 1.08, 1.09, 2.18 and 4.24). Moving the farm house is a drastic strategy for dealing with the haunt. The same strategy is employed at Baggesvogn after the violent death of the countess (JPP 2.06 and 4.20).
