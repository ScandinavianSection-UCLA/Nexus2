Since farm plots were generally small, inheritance of the land (when possible and not limited by non-inheritable leaseholds) usually went to the oldest son. In many cases there was no inheritance at all, and the oldest along with the rest of the children were essentially left to fend for themselves.\n\n     Once the children reached confirmation age, they usually left home to work at other farms. Schooling also ended at the same time. The young boy's ploy to get work from the magician echoes the switch Kirsten Marie's father plays on the beggar bailiff in an earlier story (KMP 1.03). Amusingly, the protagonist in this story has to renounce the very education that was intended to allow him to find work and contribute to society in a meaningful fashion.\n\n     Family size and the limited opportunities afforded adult children also contributed to the development of the itinerant class of beggars and merchants who are an important feature of Kirsten Marie's storytelling. The horse peddler is of course another manifestation of that itinerant class.\n\n     Tang Kristensen did not publish this tale in any of his collections.", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en G. en Mand h havde s. mange B\u00f8rn\nog s. da den [tol] \u00e6ldste blev noget stor, s.

So he left and he met someone who was riding. What are you looking for little boy. I'm out walking and looking for work. Would you like to serve me. Sure, I can just as well work for you as for someone else. Can you read. Yes, I can. We were many children but my father made sure we learned our learning. Well, then I can't use you. So he turned his clothes around and ran around back and then he met him again and then the same conversation repeats itself. Can you read. No, I certainly can't. Yes, well then I can use you. You can climb up here on back and come with me home. Then he rode home. When they got home he said, here is a room with lots of books, now I need you to keep them clean, don't do anything else. The boy read and read a bit in the books, and they were different kinds of arts, he could turn himself into whatever he wanted. And the man, they called him the black magician. Then he traveled away from the town and said to the boy: Now, take care of the books and keep them clean. There was to be a market and his father really needed money. So he decided to turn himself into a horse and his father could sell him and could get a lot of money for him. He brought him to market too and there was the black magician as well, and he recognized the horse. Then he wanted to buy him from the man. But the boy had forbidden his father, he wasn't to sell him with his halter on, take it off the horse. There were so many who wanted to buy the horse, but the black magician offered so much. He didn't want to sell it with the halter. Finally sell it with the halter, otherwise he didn't want it. He got the horse and led it home. He forbade his people to take the halter off of him. Each day he was let out and was watered, and he scraped and scraped at his nose and wanted to take the halter off. One day a young boy came out there, they had so many children, and he said, oh come on, let's take the halter off of him, he can't drink with the halter on. As soon as it came off, he turned himself into a bird and flew out of the door. Then the magician came out and turned himself into a hawk and went after the bird. Then they came to a princess's window and she saw the little bird that the hawk was chasing and she opened the window and the bird flew in and the hawk had to stay outside. A few days later, a horse dealer came there and then he said to the princess that he would now turn himself into a gold ring and put himself on her finger and the only thing the dealer wanted to buy would be the gold ring, but when you sell it, you have to let it fall on the table first. Then he turned himself into a barley corn and then the magician would turn into a rooster and take the barley corn but the boy turned himself into a fox and bit the head off of the rooster.

Men Drengen kunde nok have Lyst til at faa Tjenesten, og saa rendte han om og vendte hans Kl\u00e6der og l\u00f8b saadan omkring, at han m\u00f8dte Manden igjen. Nu gjentager det samme sig. Manden sp\u00f8rger, om han vil tjene ham, og om han kan l\u00e6se. \u201dNej, a kan saa m\u00e6nd ej,\u201d siger Drengen. \u201dJo, saa kan a bruge dig. Nu kan du s\u00e6tte dig op her bag paa, og saa f\u00f8lge med mig hjem.\u201d Saa kom han op at ride. Da de kom hjem, siger han: \u201dHer er et Kammer med saa mange B\u00f8ger, nu kan du holde dem rene, og du skal ikke bestille andet.\u201d Drengen han gik saa mellem B\u00f8gerne hver Dag og l\u00e6ste i dem. Han l\u00e6rte nu meget af dem, og der var nu saadan Anvisning paa, hvordan en skulde b\u00e6re sig ad med at gj\u00f8re Kunster og skabe sig i hvad en vilde. Manden han tjente ved, ham kaldte de den sorte Kunstner. Han rejste tit fra By, og saa sagde han til Drengen: \u201dSe nu til, du passer paa B\u00f8gerne og holder dem godt rene.\u201d Nu vidste Drengen, at hans Fader var saa forlegen for Penge, og saa h\u00f8rte han, at der skulde v\u00e6re Marked i N\u00e6rheden. Nu tykte han jo, han havde l\u00e6rt en hel Del, og saa gaar han hjem til hans Fader og siger: \u201dNu vil a skabe mig i en Hest og saa skal du tr\u00e6kke til Marked med den og s\u00e6lge den, og du kan faa mange Penge for den. Men du maa vide, du ikke s\u00e6lger den med Grimen paa, den maa du endelig huske at tage af og beholde.\u201d Det lovede Faderen, og saa tog han ham ogsaa til Marked. Den sorte Kunstner var der ogsaa, og han kunde kjende Hesten og vilde kj\u00f8be den af Manden. Der var mange andre, der vilde kj\u00f8be den Hest, for den var saa p\u00e6n, men den sorte Kunstner b\u00f8d mest. Manden vilde ikke s\u00e6lge Grimen med den, og den fremmede vilde absolut have Grimen med. Endelig b\u00f8d han saa meget, at Manden ikke tykte, han kunde lade ham gaa fra sig, men hvis han ikke kunde faa Grimen med, saa vilde han ikke have den. Altsaa slog Drengens Fader til, og den sorte Kunstner fik Hesten og trak den med sig hjem. Nu forb\u00f8d han hans Folk at tage Grimen af den. Hver Dag den var ude at blive vandet, saa skrabte den og skrabte paa N\u00e6sen og vilde absolut have Grimen af. Nu havde Kunstneren mange B\u00f8rn, og en Dag \u00e9n af dem kom derud og saa det, sagde han: \u201dAa, lad os tage Grimen af ham, han kan jo ikke godt drikke med Grimen paa.\u201d De tager den saa af, men det f\u00f8rste de har gjort det, saa skabte Hesten sig om til en Fugl, og saa fl\u00f8j han. Da kommer Kunstneren ind ad Porten i det samme, og han ser, hvad der er gaaet for sig, og skaber sig saa i en H\u00f8g og stikker \u00e6bag efter Fuglen. Den kom saa hen i N\u00e6rheden af en Prinsesses Vindue, og da hun ser den bitte Fugl, og hvordan H\u00f8gen var efter den, saa lukkede hun et Vindue op, og Fuglen fl\u00f8j ind, men H\u00f8gen maatte kj\u00f8nt blive udenfor. Fuglen skabte sig nu i en Karl og sagde til Prinsessen, at han nu vilde gj\u00f8re sig til en Guldering, som hun kunde s\u00e6tte paa hendes Finger, og saa vilde der nok komme en Handelsmand, som vilde kj\u00f8be Gulderinge, og hun maatte nok s\u00e6lge den til ham, men hun skulde lade den platte ned paa Skiven f\u00f8rst. Nogle Dage efter kom Handelsmanden ogsaa og spurgte Prinsessen, om hun ikke vilde s\u00e6lge den Guldering, hun der have paa hendes Finger. Jo, det kunde blive godt, og de blev enige om Prisen. Saa tog hun den af Fingeren og lod den platte ned paa Skiven. Da lad han sig skabe i en Bygkj\u00e6rne, og saa skabte Kunstneren sig i en Kok, for det var ingen andre end ham, der havde givet sig ud for Pranger. Kokken vilde nu tage Bygkj\u00e6rnen, men saa skabte Drengen sig i en R\u00e6v og bed Hovedet af Kokken.

When the oldest one had gotten fairly big, he decided he wanted to go out and find a job. As he is walking along, he meets a person who is riding by. \u201cWhat are you out after, little boy?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going out to find a job.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWon\u2019t you work for me?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSure, I can just as well work for you as for someone else,\u201d says the boy. \u201cCan you read?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, I can. We have a lot of children, but my father made sure on that account, we all had to learn our learning.\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, then I can\u2019t use you, I need a boy who can\u2019t read,\u201d and he rode on. But the boy now wanted the job, and so he ran around and turned his clothes inside out, and he ran over so that he met up with the man again. Now the same thing happens again. The man asks if he wants to work for him, and whether he can read. \u201cNo, I certainly cannot,\u201d says the boy. \u201cWell, then I can use you. Now you can get up here on back, and then come along with me.\u201d Then he got up to ride. When they got home, he says: \u201cHere is a room with a lot of books, you are to keep them clean and do nothing else.\u201d The boy went there among the books every day and read them. He learned a lot from them, and there was instruction in how to do magic and turn oneself into whatever one wanted. People called the man that he worked for the Black Magician. The magician often traveled, and then he would say to the boy: \u201cMake sure that you take care of the books and keep then nice and clean.\u201d Now the boy knew that his father needed money, and then he heard that there was to be a market nearby. Now he thought that he\u2019d learned quite a bit, and so he goes home to his father and says: \u201cNow I\u2019m going to turn myself into a horse and you\u2019re to bring that horse to market and sell it, and you can get a lot of money for it. But you have to remember, you are not to sell me with the halter on, you have to remember to take it off and keep it.\u201d The father promised that, and then he took him to the market. The Black Magician was there too, and he recognized the horse and wanted to buy it from the man. There were many others who wanted to buy that horse, since it was so beautiful, but the Black Magician bid the most. The man wouldn\u2019t sell the halter with it, and the magician absolutely wanted to have the halter. Finally, he bid so much that the man didn\u2019t feel he could let him walk away, but if he couldn\u2019t have the halter, then he didn\u2019t want it. Then the boy\u2019s father made a decision, and the Black Magician got the horse and led it home with him. Now the magician forbade his people from taking the halter off. Every day that it was led outside to be watered, it scraped and scraped at its nose and absolutely wanted the halter off. Now the magician had lots of children, and one day one of them came out there and saw that and he said: \u201cOh, let\u2019s take the halter off of him, he can\u2019t really drink with the halter on.\u201d They take it off, but as soon as they\u2019ve done that, the horse turned itself into a bird and flew off. Then the magician comes in the door at that moment and he sees what has happened, and he turns himself into a hawk and flies off after the bird. The bird got close to a princess\u2019s window, and when she sees the little bird and how the hawk was chasing it, she opens her window and the bird flew in, but the hawk had to stay outside. The bird changed itself into a young man and said to the princess that he was now going to turn himself into a gold ring, that she could put on her finger, and a traveling salesman (horse trader) would come who wanted to buy the ring, and she could sell it to him, but she was to let it drop onto the table first. A few days later a traveling salesman came and asked the princess if she wanted to sell the gold ring that she had on her finger. Sure, that would be good, and they agreed on the price. Then she took it off her finger and let it drop down onto the plate. Then he turned himself into a barley corn, and the magician turned himself into a rooster, because it was no other than he who had pretended to be a horse trader. The rooster wanted to take the barley corn, but then the boy turned himself into a fox and bit the head off of the rooster. Then that was the end for the magician, and the boy stayed with the princess and when he got older, he married her, and they lived happily together the rest of their lives.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["agreement", "barley", "beautiful", "birds", "black", "books", "boy", "chase", "children", "clothing", "corn", "day", "door", "drinking", "father", "finger", "fox", "gold", "hawk", "home", "horse", "job", "learning", "magic", "market", "marriage", "money", "nose", "old", "outside", "plate", "princess", "riding", "ringing", "rooster", "stranger", "table", "window", "work", "young"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Registrant over Evald Tang Kristensens Samling af Eventyr", "heading_english": "Index of Evald Tang Kristensen's collected Fairy Tales"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
