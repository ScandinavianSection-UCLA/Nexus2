It is unclear whose money it is he is counting, but in the context of Margrete's other stories of solicitous, guilty haunts, it is fairly clear that the money represents ill-gotten gains. The death of his animals at the time of his death may be linked to the nisse and his loyalty to a single farm and single farmer. This resonates with one of Margrete's first stories, in which a farmhand mentions that the mound dweller would only work with him on a specific farm (AMJ 1.05). \n\n     The conjuring of Anders V\u00e6ver proceeds without comment. Margrete endorses the common position of the minister as a successful ghost buster. That Anders himself possesses supernatural power goes without saying and may be part of the reason that he haunts. \n\n     The unusual phenomena that the men encounter when they try to steal Anders's apples are reminiscent of similar phenomena that distract people from successfully digging up buried treasure. In both cases, there is a suggestion that attempts to benefit economically without engaging in hard work are linked to the devil. Anders's willingness to wager with the men may also play a role in his subsequent haunting.\n\n      In the published collections, this story is separated from the preceding one, despite the clear narrative connection apparent in the field diaries. In the published version, the order of events is reversed so that the story of Anders V\u00e6ver's conjuring comes last, rather than first. The published version makes no mention of Anders V\u00e6ver's nisse, the thread that connects these stories with the preceding ones.", "danish_manuscript": "Der kom\nAnders V\u00e6ver h. havde ogsaa Nissen.
