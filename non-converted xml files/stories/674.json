Then it ran through the house from one end to the other and knocked the doors open. It was as if the cattle knew when it came because they got restless as soon as it had knocked the door open. The cattle that were tied up in the barn tore at their bits and mooed as if they were completely crazy, and if any of them could tear themselves free, they would and run out of the farm. After a couple of nights like that, there was nobody who would stay there and those animals that weren\u2019t moved died in their stalls. The man had said that the Evil One could come and get him; he was really bad about swearing in general. Therefore they believed that it was the Evil One who tumbled about in there.
