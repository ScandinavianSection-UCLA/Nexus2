There are several differences between the two accounts. While both descriptions of the manor lord focus on his poor treatment of the peasants, this later variant emphasizes the manor lord's reliance on corporal punishment and torture to keep them in line. The minister in the first variant is explicitly described as being \"wise,\" whereas it is implicit in this variant. Perhaps the most important difference is the identity of the interloper--in the first variant, the low status miller's farmhand interrupts the conjuring whereas, in this variant, it is the high status miller. The poor judgment of the miller in this story resonates with that of the miller in the preceding story (JPP 4.24).", "danish_manuscript": "Der var en Herremand paa Boller h. var s. \nstreng mod  hans B\u00f8nder lod dem ride Tr\u00e6\nhest o.s.v. og flere andre Torturredskaber\nbrugte.
