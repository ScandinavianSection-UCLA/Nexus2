The statement is somewhat reminiscent of the \"George Washington slept here\" signs that are a marketing ploy of inns along the east coast of the United States. \n\n     Christian IV (b.1577-d.1648), was king of Denmark and Norway from 1596 until his death.  He married Anna Kathrine in 1597, and had three of his fifteen children with her, including the later King Frederik III.  He had affairs with Kirsten Madsdatter and Karen Andersdatter, and finally a relationship with Kirsten Munk, with whom he had a written agreement to marry, but never actually wed. Kirsten Munk was the daughter of Ludvig Munk N\u00f8rlund, the owner of N\u00f8rlund since 1570.The reference to Christian IV's bridal bed should be understood in the context of Christian's numerous lovers and complicated marital arrangements.", "danish_manuscript": "Kristian den Fjerdes Brudeseng staar paa N\u00f8rlund endnu og J\u00e6germesteren hviler paa den hver G. h. kommer hertil.", "english_manuscript": "Christian the IV's wedding bed is still out at N\u00f8rlund, and the master of the hunt rests on it every time he comes there.", "danish_publication": "Unpublished", "english_publication": "Unpublished version reads: Christian the IV's wedding bed is still out at N\u00f8rlund, and the master of the hunt rests on it every time he comes there.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["bed", "Christian", "hunting", "master", "rest", "wedding"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Uudgivne historier", "heading_english": "Unpublished stories"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
