Here, the dance is quite energetic and the mound is raised on four glowing poles, suggesting that the dance takes place at night. The little man keeping watch over the dance wears the typical red stocking hat of the Danish farm worker. The red stocking hat is well-known as part of the standard attire of the farm guardian spirit, the nisse and has also been adopted in contemporary culture for Santa Claus's little helpers.\n\n     After his generalized description of the mound dwellers' dance, Peder relates a more specific legend of kidnapping. Here, the victim is danced to death by the mound folk (see also KMP 1.01, 1.42 and 1.60; AMJ 2.15). Satan also dances people to death, and so an intertextual relationship is established between the mound folk and Satan. The dancing occurs during normal farming activity and the girl has done nothing to bring this upon herself. In other variants, the hired hand seeks out the mound dwellers on his or her own accord. The death of the hired girl clearly threatens to disrupt the functioning of the farm, and has  implications for the physical well-being of the farm workers, the fecundity of the community in the future, and the economic survival of the farm. Jakob J\u00f8rgensen (DS I 717) and K. P. Dalin (DS II A 91) tell remarkably similar variants of this story.\n\n    In the published version of the story, Tang Kristensen added the remark \"and stayed dead,\" to the end of the story.", "danish_manuscript": "De er kommen ned igjennel Maannes Hule og\nhar set Dakbj. staa paa 4 gloende P\u00e6le\nog Bj\u00e6rgf. har svunget dem derunder efter\nfuld Musik og en bitte Mand med en stor\nr\u00f8d Lue paa sad og kikkede i Toppen af\nH\u00f8jen.

And for proof that there was something there, they were out haying in Alken one afternoon near the mound and one of the hired girls didn't want to go home, she felt so heavy, and so the others went and let her lie there.
