Rather, the lamb acts as a foundation sacrifice for the building of the church. Such sacrifices were intended to dispel the affects of harmful spirits or haunts. The most extreme form of such sacrifice occurs in stories about the plague. In some of those stories, children are buried at the boundary to the town or in churchyard walls to stop the disease (DS IV 1777). In other variants, the live burial is intended to help reestablish the community, and is not related to disease (DS IV 1787). The ghost of the sacrificed lamb subsequently haunts in the shape of the corpse lamb. Paradoxically, the people of the parish, in an attempt to guarantee the success of their church, unleash the innocent haunt of the lamb on the community.\n\n     The foundation sacrifice is clearly not sufficient to guarantee the successful building of the church. Usually instructions for finding the building site come from a cunning person or a community member. In this case, they come clearly from outside the community. (See also KMP 1.18 and 3.10; and AMJ 3.05).\n\n     In the published version, Tang Kristensen deleted the meta-performative reference to the story about the manor lord at Illerup, and the naming of the church, which are found in the manuscript (PJ 1.01).", "danish_manuscript": "Der gaar et Liglam for Dover Kirke, det\ngaar paa 3 Ben.
