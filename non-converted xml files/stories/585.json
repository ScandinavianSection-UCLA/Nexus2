They had a journeyman, and he could take care of the work, so the customers continued to come there. The woman felt that it cost too much with her husband lying about and finally became nasty toward him. At the same time, she became closer to the journeyman, and they decided to kill the man. The journeyman was to make a long nail for her, and she convinced him that she was going to bang it in some place so she could hang something on it. After he'd made it, she talked to him about banging it into the smith's head, and then they would have each other. She held the nail and he hit it, and then they got married and lived together for thirty years. Then one day, the gravedigger was digging at the cemetery, as he so often did, and he dug up the skull with the nail in it, and he realized that something had been covered up here. He carried the skull down to the minister, and the gravedigger was so old that he could remember who was buried there. The minister sends for the woman and asks if she could recognize her husband. No, there was no reason to talk about that since he'd been dead for thirty years. Then he came with the skull and showed it to her, and then she could recognize him. They both got to suffer their punishment here in this life, both the journeyman and the wife.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["banging", "bed", "burial", "cemetery", "day", "death", "digging", "fall", "grave", "husband", "ill", "journeyman", "kill", "marriage", "minister", "nail", "old", "punishment", "skull", "smithing", "wife", "woman", "work"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "R\u00f8vere, drabsm\u00e6nd og tyve", "heading_english": "Robbers, murderers and thieves"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
