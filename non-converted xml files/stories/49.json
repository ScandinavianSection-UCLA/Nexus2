Usually the books are identified as the Cyprianus, the anti-bible, related more to the devil than to the Christian god. Many cunning folk mixed faith healing and evangelical Christian practice with their cures (R\u00f8rbye 1976a; R\u00f8bye 1976b), and wise ministers clearly relied primarily on the bible for their magical power. The premise \"the older, the better,\" or in this case, \"the older, the more powerful\" informs this story, as does an interesting notion of contagious magic. Since this bible was ostensibly written at the time when two of the most powerful figures in Christianity were alive, the book is closer to the \"source,\" and thereby more powerful than a normal bible. It is also interesting that the woman uses her bible to curse a woman, but of course that woman had also broken the sixth and tenth commandments. Tang Kristensen eliminates this reference to reading a curse on the Bible in the published version of the story.", "danish_manuscript": "En gl.
