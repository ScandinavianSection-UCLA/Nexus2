The story's orientation is similar to that of the story of the leather reins (BJK 1.19), and presents a fairly normal situation. As the narrative progresses, the episodes become increasingly unusual. While catching the boy stealing apples constitutes a fairly normal complicating action, the proposed punishment is unusually harsh. The actual punishment is slightly less harsh. The resolution of the story situates it in the realm of the tall tale. \n\n         Jens refers to this story later on in his third session with Tang Kristensen, but either did not tell the whole story or Tang Kristensen only made short annotations because he had collected the story before (BJK 3.10).

It took so long for the man to show up, it was almost night. He didn't dare go home and so he wandered about and didn't know where he was going to spend the night. He comes back to the same place again where he was supposed to deliver the horse and their back door out to the garden is open. He goes in there and up the stairs. There were so many apples and he wanted some so he started eating as much as he could, he starts to get a little picky and so he started feeling around for the softest and best ones. This was over the man and woman's bed. She had gone to bed but the man hadn't yet, it was a pub, and the guests hadn't left yet. The woman hears this and she says to the man that there were thieves in the attic. He gets someone to come along with him and he lights a lamp and finds Kro-Niels in the apples and drags him down to the main room. They should do something to him for doing that. They could take the money for the horse from him. No, that would be a shame, says the woman, then his father would break his back when he comes home. Can't we figure out something else to do to him? Sure, the man came up with something, they had a fox cage out in the back yard, he'd put him in there until the morning. Stuffs him into that and closes it. Well later that night the fox came and ran about and sniffed the fox cage and he could smell something. There were bars on one end and he reaches out his arm and gets hold of the fox's tail. It runs off with him and he continues to hold on. After a while, the cage broke apart, he was totally lost and had no idea where he was. So he stood there and looked around, he was on top of R\u00e6vild Kold, and then he could see his house.

Han kommer til Nibe, men det blev n\u00e6sten aften, inden manden kommer og tager imod hesten. S\u00e5 blev det m\u00f8rkt, og han turde ikke g\u00e5 hjem, hvorfor han gik og daskede omkring en lidt. Nu vidste han jo ikke, hvor han skulde v\u00e6re om natten, og s\u00e5 kommer han til det samme sted igjen, hvor han skulde levere hesten, det var i et v\u00e6rtshus, og der stod bagd\u00f8ren \u00e5ben.

S\u00e5 gik kisten i stykker omsider, og han kommer ud. Men han var helt vildt og vidste aldrig, hvor han var. Som han nu stod og s\u00e5 sig omkring, blev han klog p\u00e5, at han stod ovenp\u00e5 R\u00e6vild Kold, og derfra, kunde han se hjem.
