In that respect, this widely attested legend is closely related to legends of the would-be ghost (ML3005). In most variants of this legend, the minister is called to offer last rites, another parallel to stories of the would-be ghost (DS III 1233). There is a suggestion in some stories that playing tricks on the minister was a common occurrence (DS III 1238). The trick, although seemingly innocuous (and amusingly similar to contemporary \"crank calls\"), clearly violates the minister's trust. As with stories of the would-be ghost, the stories do not agree on the involvement of the minister in the sinking: does he cause it, or is it caused by the ungodliness of the actions? The forgotten Bible is always recovered.\n\n     The published version is slightly abbreviated, with several inexplicable deletions.", "danish_manuscript": "I Madum S\u00f8je har der staaet en Grd.
