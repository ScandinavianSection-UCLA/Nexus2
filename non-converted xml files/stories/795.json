Then she was told that she should put some church dirt in a cloth and put it next to them, she was to get it from a cemetery at midnight. But she couldn't get anyone to go up there and get it, they were all afraid. Finally, a hired hand stepped forward, he felt that he was the bravest. But when he got to the cemetery wall, his courage failed him, and he didn't dare go in there either. When he was on the way back, he went in and took some dirt from their garden and he gave her that. Then her toothache stopped. A little later, the farmhand left that farm and got work at another place. He was gone for three or four years, but came back to the town for a visit. Then he also wanted to go in and visit with the people he'd worked for. \"Well, how are things with your tooth?\" he says to the girl, \"has it been bad again since?\" No, she thanked him because he'd done that daring thing. He told her what the dirt was. As soon as she heard that, the tooth was bad again.", "keywords": {"keyword": ["advice", "afraid", "bravery", "cemetery", "church", "clothing", "courage", "dirt", "farm", "farmhand", "garden", "girl", "midnight", "thank", "three", "tooth", "toothache", "town", "walls", "work"]}, "etk_index": {"heading_danish": "Pest og sygdomme", "heading_english": "Plague and illnesses"}, "tango_indices": {"tango_index": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]}, "genre": null}
