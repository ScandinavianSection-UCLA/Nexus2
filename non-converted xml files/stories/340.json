In other variants, ministers or cunning folk are called to counteract the haunting (DS V 700; Tangherlini 1999).  The story's orientation presents the frightening specter of headless horses on their nocturnal ride to the church (KMP 1.14). No reason is given for the haunting, although one suspects that, given the ghost's royally conferred title, he is a guilty haunt. The farmhand's attempt to restore order ends in his death. In the original manuscript version, a second farmhand loses his life as well. That the stall door must be left open is an indication of the ongoing disruption of the economic space of the farm.", "danish_manuscript": "Det var den gl.
