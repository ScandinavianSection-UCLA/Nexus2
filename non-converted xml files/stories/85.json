The clothing described is old-fashioned, and similar to descriptions of the clothing of rakkere (rakker means executioner's assistant and, later, nightman or refuse collector; it was often used as slang to denote a vagabond). \"Langovrede tr\u00e6sko\" were clogs with a long front worn primarily by men in contradistinction to women's \"kortovrede tr\u00e6sko\" with a short front, more in keeping with modern clogs. \"Basarer\" are also known as \"nisse tr\u00e6sko\".
