  <annotation>The tension between the peasants, who had to do villeinage at the manor farm, and the large land owners, who leased land to the peasants, informs this story. Here, the two farmers' amusing speculation about how different the rich really are leads the one farmer to put his money (or at least his horse and wagon) where his mouth is. Double entendres add significant humor to the story. The man's final evaluation of the countess as no different from anyone else is an endorsement of the liberal policies that had taken root in the peasant class--as well as among the urban elite--that people were equal, regardless of social class and wealth. It was this liberal thinking that ushered in an era of broad social and political change, from the democratic constitution of the mid nineteenth century to increasingly progressive social policies up through the early years of the twentieth century.

     The leaseholds under Baggesvogn were sold at the beginning of the nineteenth century, although many of these sales included villeinage. Villeinage was seen unanimously by farmers and smallholders alike to be an undue burden. One of the main goals of the Venstre party in the period after the promulgation of the constitution was to pass legislation that would substitute cash payments for the in-kind work of villeinage.

    Baggesvogn is five kilometers north of Sindal and was originally built in the fifteenth century. The main building was built in 1744. The dating of the legend is a bit off, as the Count Feer alluded to in the story was probably Peter Chr. de F&#xE6;dder, who owned Baggesvogn from 1799-1803. He married Kirstine Gleerup (d. 1826), who was the daughter of the previous owner, Mourids Gleerup (d. 1820). From 1803-1812, Baggesvogn was owned by Georg  Moltke-Rosenkrantz, who in turn sold the estate to Michael Aagaard, who went bankrupt in 1820. In the more than five hundred years since it was first mentioned in the historical record, Baggesvogn has had 38 owners. </annotation>

  <english_manuscript>In 1806, there was a count named Feer at Baggesvogn. He was quite hard on his peasants and he tormented and harassed them with work. One day all the peasants were gathered for villeinage and were supposed to drive the grain. There were two peasants who accompanied each other from Sindal and the countess was out walking in the woods. The one says to the other, "That's a beautiful woman." - "Yes," says the other, "that's a beautiful woman, it must be fantastic to sleep with one like that." Then the first one says that he'd gladly give his horses and wagon in exchange for the chance. The countess out in the garden hears this. As soon as they had unloaded their wagons and were going to drive off again, the man gets a message that he should go up to her. Would he stand by what he'd said? Yes, he sure would, he says. What was it he'd said? Yes, he'd give his horses and wagon to sleep with her. Then she tells the servant that he should unharness the man's horses and drive the wagon down into the courtyard. Then the man went in with her a little bit, it really wasn't too long, and then he thought he was going to get his horses and wagon back, but he didn't get them. Now he has to walk home, and so he's walking along and complaining, saying: Well, the one was pretty much like the other, he didn't notice that there was any great change, it was still the same. Then he comes to the count who was out in the field and he scolds him, why was he walking along and why didn't he have horses or a wagon. "Well," he says, "the countess took it from me, because she said that my load was smaller than the others', but I couldn't tell that there was any difference, I thought my load was just as big as theirs." "I see," says the count, "that's no good, you can follow me home to the farm, then you'll get your horses and your wagon back." Then they accompanied each other and come in to the countess. "Listen here, my dear wife," says the count, "is it true that you took the horses and wagon from this man?" "Yes, it is true." "He says that his load was smaller than the others'." "Yes, it was, too." "Yes, but you can't be that strict," says the count. "He is to have his horses and wagon back." "OK, OK, he'll get them too." He got his things and he could start driving grain again, and then that was done with. The count died a year later.</english_manuscript>
