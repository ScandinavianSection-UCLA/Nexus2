  <annotation>Peder continues with descriptions of unusual finds in the local landscape. The description of a stone altar, and his story about its presumed use, allows him to emerge as an expert about local history. The suggestion is that this particular stone setting was a remnant of the middle ages. The earliest Nordic history was a topic that had gained great popularity in Denmark during the nineteenth century in large part due to the work of the theologian NFS Grundtvig and the folk high school movement.</annotation>
  <danish_manuscript>Paa Svejstrup Mark fortalte min Plejefor&#230;ldre
var et Offersted. Der var to Sten ved Siderne
den bager Sten gik op med noget som et
Bagslag og selve Kanten af det var helt hvas
og s. var der to Liggere over Sidestenen med
en Aabning imellem, s. naar de gjorde Ild under
den, s. kunde den Ild br&#230;nde op imellem
Stenene og br&#230;nde Msket der var sp&#230;ndt
paa og Bagslavet var til at knuse Rygge

3800B
paa den med. Fra hans Drengetid af kaldtes 
Stenen St&#248;en (st&#230;jet): St&#230;vnestedet. Se der 
st&#248;ent de hinanden til det gjorde Folkene,
naar noget skulde forhandles, de skulde v&#230;re
f&#230;lles om. Marken den stod paa var lige
saa flad som dh. Stuegulv.

  <english_manuscript>My foster father said that there was a spot where they made sacrifices on Svejstrup mark (field). There were two stones on the sides, the stone in back went up with something like a backrest and even the edge of it was very sharp, and then there were two stones on top of the side stones and there was an opening between them, so when they made a fire underneath them, the fire could burn up in between the stones and burn the person who was tied up on top, and the backrest was there to crush his back. Since his boyhood the stone was called St&#248;en (st&#230;jet): the meeting place. They used to summon each other to meet there, people did, when something that they had to decide together had to be worked out. The field that they stood on was just as flat as the floor in this room.</english_manuscript>
