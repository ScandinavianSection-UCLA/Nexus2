I used the attributesToElements.xsl to transform the xml files.

I just manually updated the name of the xml file in my converter.py program,
which writes the converted file to a new xml (manually created) file
(i just created a new one with c in front of the original name).

I executed the python program using "python converter.py" in terminal, but you need
to install lxml for it to work.

The keywords file is pretty massive
