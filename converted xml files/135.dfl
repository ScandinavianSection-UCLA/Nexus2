  <annotation>Jens returns to the realm of folk remedies with this short description. Toothache was a significant worry in rural Denmark. Accordingly, anything that could stave off a toothache was likely to be well known and commonly practiced. Putting a dung beetle in one's mouth is hardly appetizing and conjures images of television shows such as Fear Factor. H.C. Andersen wrote perhaps the best account of the horror of the toothache in his short story "Tante Tandpine" (Auntie Toothache). The boy in that story dies from his abscessed tooth.

     This particular remedy remained unpublished. Other remedies for toothache include sucking on cemetery mud (DS IV 2015), or other more involved rituals with horseshoe nails (DS IV 2016) or other sharp sticks (DS IV 2018)--a form of sympathetic magic.</annotation>
