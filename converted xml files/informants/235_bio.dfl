Kirsten Marie was the daughter of Ane Rasmusdatter and Peder Andersen, a small holder and tenant farmer, who later managed to buy a farm. She learned most of her stories and legends from her mother who had learned them, in turn, from her father. He was such a good teller that he could gather all the people at a party around him to hear his stories. Her brother was Rasmus Kj&#230;r Pedersen, a farm owner, who introduced Tang Kristensen to her. She was the best informant that Tang Kristensen met on his collecting trip in the spring of 1890 in eastern Jutland, and she continued to be one of his best informants. Tang Kristensen enjoyed visiting her house, not only because she was an eager and competent informant, but also because of the warm reception he received from her, her husband and her daughter.
