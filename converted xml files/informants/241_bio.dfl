Jens lived alone in his house in Ilbj&#230;rge, and told Tang Kristensen that he was a widower. This self-characterization was not entirely true, and his biography is one filled with unexpected twists. He was the son of Peder Christian Pedersen, a husmand, and Johanne Nielsdatter. He had learned many of his stories from his father, although his mother and maternal grandmother also told many stories. He lived in poverty and enjoyed talking to Tang Kristensen.
