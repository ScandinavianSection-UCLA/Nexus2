Her father had traveled out of the country as a soldier and, upon his return, had received land from the court. He had many books and was a good story teller and singer, especially of folk tales and ballads. She learned many of her stories and ballads from traveling tradesmen and learned them easily. She was a congenial and adept narrator and singer.
